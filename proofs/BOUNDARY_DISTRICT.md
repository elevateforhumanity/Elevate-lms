# Operational Boundaries for District Use

**School District / K-12 / CTE Version**

**Purpose:** To ensure audit safety, staff sustainability, and predictable program delivery, we are explicit about what the platform governs and what remains under district control.

---

## What We Do (District Context)

- Enforce enrollment, completion, and credentialing as distinct, auditable events
- Maintain district-safe workflows that reduce staff follow-up and error
- Provide clear student next steps to reduce confusion and counselor load
- Support admin-by-exception operations (approvals, not tracking)
- Preserve continuity across staffing or leadership changes

---

## What You Control

- Program offerings (CTE, workforce, pathways)
- Eligibility and participation rules
- Partner relationships
- Credential naming and alignment
- Instructional delivery

---

## What We Don't Do (Important for Districts)

- We do not allow ad hoc lifecycle changes per program or school
- We do not support running some programs manually "on the side"
- We do not bypass governance for convenience
- We do not replace instructional oversight or curriculum decisions

**These constraints exist to protect the district during audits and reporting.**

## How Changes Are Handled

| Category | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Configuration** | Immediate |

## District Framing

When introducing this document, say:

> "This keeps us audit-safe without adding staff or risk."
