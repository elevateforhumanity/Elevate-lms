# Persona-Specific Renewal & Expansion Scripts

Use the version that matches the room. Do not mix them.

---

## 1) School District / K-12 Workforce Programs

**Audience:** Superintendent, CTE Director, Board, CFO

**How they think:**
- Risk-averse, board-sensitive
- Fear of audits, FERPA issues, public scrutiny
- Staff capacity is already stretched

**What you emphasize:** Governance, audit safety, reduction in staff chaos

### Language

**Opening anchor:**
> "From a district perspective, the system has become operational infrastructure."

**Dependency question:**
> "If this platform disappeared tomorrow, what would break first?"

*(They usually say: enrollment tracking, credentials, compliance reporting.)*

**Value framing:**
> "What changed is that enrollment, completion, and credentialing are now system-enforced—not staff-enforced. That's how districts stay audit-safe without adding headcount."

**Expansion pivot:**
> "The risk isn't adding programs. The risk is running some programs governed and others manually."

**Pricing frame:**
> "Renewal simply preserves audit-safe operations. Expansion prevents exceptions from creeping back in."

**Close:**
> "This is about protecting the district operationally, not buying software."

## 2) Nonprofit / Workforce Development / Grant-Funded

**Audience:** Executive Director, Program Manager, Funders nearby

**How they think:**
- Mission-driven
- Grant deadlines
- High staff burnout
- Fear of losing funding due to reporting issues

**What you emphasize:** Speed to outcomes, funder confidence, staff relief

### Language

**Opening anchor:**
> "This platform moved you from managing programs to delivering outcomes."

**Dependency question:**
> "If this system disappeared, where would staff time immediately get burned?"

*(They usually say: tracking, reporting, certificates.)*

**Value framing:**
> "The system removed follow-ups, manual tracking, and certificate bottlenecks. That's staff time back on mission."

**Expansion pivot:**
> "Funders don't want parallel processes. Expansion keeps outcomes consistent across programs."

**Pricing frame:**
> "Renewal protects funder confidence. Expansion protects staff capacity."

**Close:**
> "This lets you grow impact without growing chaos."

## 3) State / Government Agency

**Audience:** Deputy Director, Program Officer, Compliance

**How they think:**
- Accountability first
- Failure avoidance
- Longevity beyond leadership changes

**What you emphasize:** Determinism, audit defensibility, continuity

### Language

**Opening anchor:**
> "This system now functions as a system of record, not a tool."

**Dependency question:**
> "If the platform were removed, which compliance obligations would immediately be at risk?"

**Value framing:**
> "What matters here is determinism. Actions produce outcomes consistently, with no human interpretation required."

**Expansion pivot:**
> "Exceptions are where agencies get exposed. Expansion reduces exceptions."

**Pricing frame:**
> "This is not discretionary software. It's operational assurance."

**Close:**
> "Renewal maintains continuity across administrations."

## 4) Corporate / Internal Training

**Audience:** L&D Director, HR, Operations

**How they think:**
- ROI
- Efficiency
- Scale

**What you emphasize:** Reduced operational friction, scalability without rebuilds

### Language

**Opening anchor:**
> "This removed coordination work that doesn't scale."

**Dependency question:**
> "What manual processes came off your team's plate?"

**Value framing:**
> "The system enforces completion and credentialing without management overhead."

**Expansion pivot:**
> "Scaling without governance just multiplies exceptions."

**Pricing frame:**
> "Renewal preserves efficiency. Expansion preserves consistency."

## How You Use These

- Do **not** announce the persona
- Listen for cues (language, concerns, roles)
- Switch to the matching script naturally

**If someone crosses personas** (e.g., nonprofit with state funding), default to state-level language. It's safer.

## Final Control Rule

If the buyer starts asking:
- "Can we change the core logic?"
- "What if we just run some programs outside?"
- "Can staff override this?"

**Respond calmly:**
> "That's exactly what this system was designed to prevent."

Then stop talking.
