# The 5-Minute Executive Demo

For presidents, superintendents, deans, boards, CFOs.
Short attention, high authority. Prove control, not depth.

---

## Minute 0–0:30: Frame (Non-Negotiable)

Open with this:

> "I'm going to show you how the system behaves, not how it's built."
> "If the behavior fits how you operate, we keep talking."

Then move immediately.

---

## Minute 0:30–2:00: Student Journey (Governance in Motion)

**Show:** Program → Enrollment start → `/lms/dashboard`

**Say:**
> "Students don't just enroll. They enter a governed lifecycle."

**Point to:**
- The dashboard
- The dominant action

**Then this line:**
> "The system tells the student what to do next."

*Pause.*

**Why this works:** Execs instantly understand reduced confusion, fewer emails, fewer staff escalations.

---

## Minute 2:00–3:30: Completion → Credential (Trust Moment)

**Do not rush this.**

**Say:**
> "Enrollment, training, and credentialing are separate events."
> "Completion automatically issues credentials—no one does this by hand."

**Then the key executive line:**
> "That's how you stay audit-safe without adding staff."

*Pause again.*

---

## Minute 3:30–4:30: Admin-by-Exception

**Briefly show:** Admin view

**Say:**
> "Staff intervene only when something needs judgment."
> "The system moves forward on its own."

**Then:**
> "This removes operational drag."

---

## Minute 4:30–5:00: Close (Do NOT Sell)

**End with this:**

> "This is already running live."
> "The question isn't whether it can be built."
> "It's whether you want to own this complexity."

*Stop. No pitch. No next slide.*
