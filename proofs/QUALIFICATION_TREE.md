## Step 1 — Core Question

**Did they accept the premise that governance > features?**

- YES → proceed
- NO → not a buyer

**If NO, stop. Do not chase.**

---

## Step 2 — Build Signals

Count how many of these occurred:

- [ ] Asked about stack before outcomes
- [ ] Wanted schema/code access immediately
- [ ] Suggested running "some programs outside the system"
- [ ] Focused on customization of core logic
- [ ] Minimized audit or compliance risk

**2 or more = Builder, not buyer**

→ Send Email 3

---

## Step 3 — Operational Pain Signals

Count how many they mentioned unprompted:

- [ ] Manual tracking
- [ ] Staff overload
- [ ] Certificate delays
- [ ] Reporting/audit stress
- [ ] Partner follow-ups

**3 or more = Real buyer**

→ Proceed to pricing conversation

---

## Step 4 — Authority Check

Was at least one of the following present?

- [ ] Budget owner
- [ ] Program owner with delivery accountability
- [ ] Executive sponsor
- [ ] Clear path to approval

**If NO → discovery only**

→ Send Email 2

---

## Step 5 — Urgency Check

Did they reference:

- [ ] Upcoming launch
- [ ] Funding deadline
- [ ] Program expansion
- [ ] External pressure (board, funder, agency)

**If YES → prioritize**
**If NO → deprioritize (but don't disengage)**

## Final Classification

| Classification | Criteria | Action |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| **BUYER** | Governance accepted + operational pain + authority present | Move to pricing |
| **FUTURE BUYER** | Governance accepted, authority unclear | Nurture (Email 2) |
| **BUILDER** | Stack fixation, governance resistance, low urgency | Exit (Email 3) |

**Your time goes only to the first category.**
