## Email 1 — Strong Fit / Move to Pricing

**Subject:** Next steps

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the conversation today.

Based on what you shared, the platform aligns with how you operate: governed enrollment, deterministic completion, and credentialing without manual overhead.

The next step is to confirm operational scope (programs, learners, partners) so pricing can be framed accurately.

Let me know a good time to walk through that, or feel free to send the details directly.

Best,
[Your name]

**Why this works:**
- Assumes fit
- Frames pricing as mechanical
- No selling language

## Email 2 — Fit, Needs Internal Alignment

**Subject:** Internal framing

Hi [Name],

Appreciate the discussion today.

I'm attaching a one-page internal approval brief that outlines the build-vs-license decision in operational terms. Many teams use this to align leadership before moving forward.

Once there's internal clarity, we can pick back up on scope and timing.

Best,
[Your name]

**Why this works:**
- Removes you from internal politics
- Keeps momentum without chasing

## Email 3 — Not Ready / Build-Leaning (Qualify Out)

**Subject:** Following up

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the time today.

It sounds like you're still evaluating whether to build or buy. When that decision becomes clearer, I'm happy to reconnect and see if the platform fits where you land.

Best of luck with the evaluation,
[Your name]

**Why this works:**
- Graceful exit
- Preserves authority
- No discounting, no persuasion
