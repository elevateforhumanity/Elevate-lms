# Top 3 Buyer Follow-Up Questions (After the 90-Second Script)

---

## Question 1: "What can we customize vs. what's locked?"

**Answer (30 seconds):**

"Programs, branding, and communications are fully customizable. You define your own program types, credential names, certificate appearance, and email templates.

What's governed—and intentionally locked—is the lifecycle logic: enrollment must complete before training starts, training must complete before credentials issue, and credentials issue automatically when requirements are met.

You can extend the platform. You cannot break the sequence that makes it auditable."

**Key phrase to land:** "Extend, not break."

## Question 2: "How long does implementation take?"

**Answer (30 seconds):**

"A single program can be live in days—configuration, not development. You define the program, funding path, and credential. The enrollment and completion logic already exists.

Multi-program rollouts with partner integrations typically take 4–6 weeks, depending on how many funding sources and approval workflows you need configured.

The difference from a build is that you're configuring a working system, not waiting for one to be built."

**Key phrase to land:** "Configuration, not development."

## Question 3: "What happens if we need something the platform doesn't do?"

**Answer (30 seconds):**

"Two paths. If it's a configuration—new program type, new credential, new notification—you or we can add it without touching core logic. That's same-week work.

If it's a structural change to the lifecycle—like changing when credentials issue or adding a new approval gate—that's roadmap. We scope it, schedule it, and implement it in a way that doesn't break existing programs.

The distinction matters: extensions are fast, structural changes are deliberate."

**Key phrase to land:** "Extensions are fast, structural changes are deliberate."

## Delivery Notes

- Answer only the question asked. Do not elaborate.
- End each answer and pause. Let them ask the next question.
- If they ask something outside these three, say: "That's a good implementation question—let's cover it in the scoping call."

## If They Go Silent

That's a buying signal. Say:

"Would it help to see the system running, or do you want to talk about what a pilot would look like?"

Then stop. Let them choose the next step.
