# Deflection Lines (Stop Derailment Without Sounding Closed)

---

## 1. "Can our developers poke around the code?"

**What they're doing:** Testing control and optionality.

**Your response:**
"Absolutely—in a controlled sandbox."
For evaluation, we keep the governed core read-only so nothing breaks accidentally. If there's serious interest, we do a structured extensibility session where your team can safely customize without risking outcomes.

*Then stop.*

## 2. "What stack is this built on?"

**What they're doing:** Trying to reduce the decision to familiarity.

**Your response:**
"We can cover the stack, but it's not the decision driver."
The hard part here isn't the language—it's the lifecycle enforcement and operational guarantees. We usually save stack details for technical diligence after alignment.

*Stop talking.*

## 3. "Couldn't we just modify X ourselves?"

**What they're doing:** Looking for permission to fork responsibility back onto themselves.

**Your response:**
"You could—but that's an intentional decision, not a default."
The platform is designed so core lifecycle changes are deliberate, scoped, and governed. That's how you avoid accidental breakage later.

*Pause. Let that sit.*

---

## 4. "Can you show us the database / schema / internals?"

**What they're doing:** Fishing for leverage or reassurance.

**Your response:**
"Happy to—at the right stage."
At this point, the question is whether the outcomes and governance model fit. Deep internals come after that decision.

*Then stop.*

---

## 5. "We'd need to think about this."

**What they're doing:** Soft exit.

**Your response:**
"Of course."
Before you do, can I ask—what would you need to be confident moving forward?

*This either re-engages them or cleanly qualifies them out.*
