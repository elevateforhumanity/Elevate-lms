# Operational Boundaries for Funded Programs

**Nonprofit / Workforce / Grant-Funded Version**

**Purpose:** To protect funding, reduce staff burnout, and scale outcomes responsibly, the platform enforces clear operational boundaries.

---

## What We Do (Nonprofit Context)

- Enforce deterministic outcomes tied to completion
- Automate notifications so staff don't chase tasks
- Maintain grant-ready audit trails
- Reduce reliance on spreadsheets and side processes
- Support rapid program launches without technical rebuilds

---

## What You Control

- Program design and delivery
- Funder-specific rules and requirements
- Partner organizations
- Communications and branding
- Credential definitions

---

## What We Don't Do (Important for Funded Work)

- We do not allow manual overrides to become the default
- We do not support parallel processes that undermine reporting
- We do not customize core logic per grant
- We do not trade governance for short-term convenience

**These boundaries protect funding credibility.**
