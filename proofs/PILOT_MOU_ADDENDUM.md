# PILOT / MOU ADDENDUM

## Limited Deployment & Evaluation Terms

> **Use for pilots, grants, MOUs, or "we need to test this first."**
> This keeps pilots from turning into unpaid production.

---

## 1. Pilot Purpose

The purpose of this Pilot is to evaluate operational fit, usability, and outcomes for a limited set of programs and users.

**This Pilot is not intended to represent full production deployment.**

---

## 2. Pilot Scope

The Pilot is limited to:

| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| **Programs** | [1–2 programs named explicitly] |
| **Learners** | [maximum number] |
| **Duration** | [e.g., 90 days] |
| **Partners (if any)** | [named] |

**Any expansion beyond this scope requires written agreement.**

## 3. Included Capabilities

During the Pilot, Client will have access to:

- Standard enrollment workflows
- Program completion tracking
- Credential issuance (as configured)
- Administrative review features
- Reporting relevant to pilot evaluation

---

## 4. Exclusions During Pilot

- No assumption of long-term availability

---

## 5. Feedback and Changes

Feedback will be collected and reviewed.
**Implementation of changes is not guaranteed during the Pilot period.**

---

## 6. Conversion to Production

At Pilot conclusion, parties may:

1. **Convert** to a production license,
2. **Extend** the Pilot by mutual agreement, or
3. **Conclude** the Pilot without obligation.

**No rights to continued use are implied beyond the Pilot term.**

---

## 7. Risk Acknowledgement

## Why This Works

- Prevents pilot creep
- Protects you from "but you let us do it in the pilot"
- Creates a natural conversion moment

---

## When to Use

- Budget-constrained buyers who need to "test first"
- Grant-funded organizations with approval cycles
- Risk-averse institutions that won't commit without proof
- MOUs that need formal structure without full contract
