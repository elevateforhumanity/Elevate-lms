# 90-Day Success Scorecard

**Purpose:** Objectively confirm value, surface expansion signals, and anchor renewal
**Audience:** Executive sponsor + operational owner
**Format:** 30-minute review, facts only

---

## Section 1 — Launch & Adoption (Foundation)

**Goal:** Confirm the system is actually being used as intended.

| Criteria | Y/N |
|----------|-----|
| Programs launched as planned (no scope rollback) | |
| Students successfully enrolled without staff intervention | |
| Students followed system-directed "next actions" | |
| No parallel spreadsheets or shadow processes created | |
| Staff log in to approve/review, not to track or chase | |

**Interpretation:**
- All YES → proceed
- Any NO → diagnose immediately (this predicts churn if ignored)

---

## Section 2 — Operational Efficiency (Where Value Shows)

**Goal:** Prove reduced staff burden and fewer exceptions.

| Criteria | Y/N |
|----------|-----|
| Document uploads triggered automatic staff notifications | |
| Average document review time decreased vs prior process | |
| Certificates issued automatically on completion | |
| No manual certificate issuance required in normal flow | |
| Partners did not require follow-up emails to act | |

**Key question you ask (verbatim):**
> "What stopped requiring human follow-up after launch?"

**That answer is your ROI narrative.**

---

## Section 3 — Governance & Risk (Executive Buy-In)

**Goal:** Confirm audit and compliance confidence.

| Criteria | Y/N |
|----------|-----|
| Enrollment, completion, and credentialing are clearly distinct | |
| Reports can be reproduced without reconciliation | |
| No disputes about "who completed what and when" | |
| Leadership expresses confidence in system outputs | |
| No emergency process overrides were required | |

**Interpretation:**
- If leadership trusts the system, renewal is easy
- If leadership asks for "backups," something is drifting

---

## Section 4 — Student Experience (Silent Signals)

**Goal:** Detect friction before complaints surface.

**Review:**
- Drop-off points in the lifecycle
- Time spent in "pending" states
- Support tickets related to confusion or delays
- Student questions that indicate unclear next steps

**Key insight:**
Silence here is good. Fewer questions = better system guidance.

---

## Section 5 — Partner & Stakeholder Signals

**Goal:** Validate external confidence.

| Criteria | Y/N |
|----------|-----|
| Partners received automated notifications as expected | |
| Partners did not request side channels (email/text) | |
| Stakeholders reference the system as "the source of truth" | |
| No partner escalations due to missed actions | |

**If partners trust the system, expansion is unlocked.**

---

## Section 6 — Expansion Readiness (Drives Growth)

**Goal:** Identify natural next steps, not forced upsell.

| Signal | Yes / Not Yet |
|--------|---------------|
| Additional programs ready to onboard | |
| Additional learner groups identified | |
| New partners asking to be included | |
| Interest in advanced reporting or outcomes tracking | |
| Internal teams asking "can we use this for X?" | |

**Rule:** Expansion should be pulled by demand, not pushed by sales.

---

## Section 7 — Renewal Anchor (Executive Close)

**Close the review with this exact question:**

> "If this system disappeared tomorrow, what would break?"

*Let them answer.*

**Then say:**

> "That's what renewal protects."

No pricing discussion yet. Just alignment.

---

## How You Score Success (Internal)

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Green** | Operational efficiency + governance confidence + expansion signals | Renew + Expand |
| **Yellow** | Adoption solid, but scope discipline slipped | Renew + Stabilize |
| **Red** | Manual workarounds reappearing, unclear ownership, low trust | Intervene |

---

## How You Introduce This (Important)

**Say this at kickoff, not at Day 90:**

> "At 90 days, we'll review success against objective criteria. That's how we decide what comes next."

**That sentence alone changes client behavior.**

---

## What This Scorecard Does

- Turns value into evidence
- Makes renewal logical, not emotional
- Frames expansion as operational maturity
- Prevents quiet churn
- Positions you as a strategic partner, not a vendor
