## INTERNAL APPROVAL MEMO

**Subject:** Approval Request — License vs. Internal Build for Program Operations Platform

**Prepared by:** [Name / Title]
**Department:** [Department / Division]
**Date:** [Date]

---

## Executive Summary (Read This First)

We are requesting approval to license an existing governed program operations platform rather than building one internally.

While internal development is technically possible, analysis indicates that licensing significantly reduces delivery risk, operational overhead, and time-to-launch, while preserving institutional control over programs, branding, and rules.

**This request is about risk management and speed, not convenience.**

---

## The Problem We Are Solving

Our current and planned programs require a system that can reliably manage:

- student enrollment and approvals,
- funding or eligibility pathways,
- document intake and review,
- partner coordination,
- program completion, and
- credential issuance with auditability.

These are operational workflows, not just instructional content.

Manual coordination or partial systems introduce delays, staff burden, and audit risk as programs scale.

## Build vs. License — What We Learned

### Internal Build (What It Actually Involves)

An internal build would require us to design, implement, and maintain:

- a governed enrollment lifecycle,
- a state-driven student experience,
- document workflows with audit trails,
- deterministic credential issuance tied to completion (not payment),
- automated notifications to students, staff, and partners,
- safeguards against duplicate or inconsistent outcomes, and
- long-term ownership of security, failure modes, and staff turnover risk.

These requirements typically become fully visible *after* launch, when correction is expensive.

### Licensing (What It Provides)

Licensing provides:

- a proven, governed lifecycle that already enforces these rules,
- deterministic outcomes (actions reliably produce results),
- admin-by-exception operations (reduced staff overhead),
- built-in auditability,
- safe extensibility for institution-specific needs, and
- significantly faster time-to-launch.

We retain control over programs, branding, partners, and rules without owning the underlying machinery.

---

## Risk and Opportunity Cost

The primary risk of building internally is not technical feasibility but:

- delayed program launches,
- increased manual staff processes,
- reliance on key individuals,
- difficulty maintaining governance over time, and
- compounding maintenance burden.

The opportunity cost includes missed funding windows, delayed outcomes, and stalled initiatives while infrastructure is being built and corrected.

---

## Financial Framing

Licensing costs should be evaluated against:

- avoided build time,
- avoided permanent headcount,
- reduced operational risk, and
- faster realization of program outcomes.

**This is not a feature purchase. It is a risk transfer and acceleration decision.**

---

## Recommendation

**Approve licensing of the platform and proceed with configuration and rollout.**

This approach allows us to:

- launch programs faster,
- reduce operational burden,
- maintain governance and audit readiness, and
- focus internal resources on delivery and outcomes rather than infrastructure.

---

## Requested Decision

- ☐ Approve licensing and implementation
- ☐ Request additional information
- ☐ Decline (with rationale)

---

## Notes

This decision does not prevent future internal development.
It intentionally avoids assuming long-term ownership of high-risk operational infrastructure.

## How You Use This

- Give this **after** the demo or serious discussion
- Do **not** walk through it line by line
- Say: "This is the internal framing most institutions use to get approval."

**It does the selling when you are not in the room.**
