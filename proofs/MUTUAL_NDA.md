## How to Use This

Introduce it with one sentence only:

> "This just protects both sides while we evaluate fit."

Then stop talking.

**Why this NDA works:**
- It's mutual (low resistance)
- It's short (legal teams don't stall)
- It protects demos, pricing, and process
- It doesn't overclaim IP or restrict normal operations
