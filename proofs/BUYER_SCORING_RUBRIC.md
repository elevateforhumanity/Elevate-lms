## Quick Decision (30 Seconds After Call)

Ask yourself:

1. **Would I bet $1,000 they'll buy in 90 days?**
   - Yes → Send pricing
   - No → Why not? Fix that or move on.

2. **Did they ask about timing or did I have to bring it up?**
   - They asked → Real buyer
   - I brought it up → Tire kicker

3. **Can I name the specific program they'd launch first?**
   - Yes → Ready for pilot conversation
   - No → They're not serious yet

## Who Gets What

| Score | They Get |
|-------|----------|
| Strong buyer (3+/2+/2+/0) | Pricing tiers + pilot proposal |
| Medium (3+/1/1/0) | Written brief + follow-up call scheduled |
| Weak (2 or less in any category) | Brief only, no follow-up unless they initiate |
| Red flags | Nothing. Polite close. |

## The One Rule

**Never send pricing to someone who hasn't demonstrated problem fit.**

Pricing without context becomes a negotiation anchor against you.
Pricing with context becomes a decision tool for them.
