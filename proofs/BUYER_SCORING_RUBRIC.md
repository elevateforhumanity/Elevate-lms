# Buyer Qualification Scorecard

This is how you decide who gets pricing and who doesn't.
Score each item Yes/No during or after the call.

---

## Category 1 — Problem Awareness

| Signal | Y/N |
|--------|-----|
| They acknowledge operational pain (manual tracking, staff load, delays) | |
| They distinguish enrollment ≠ completion ≠ credentialing | |
| They reference compliance, audit, or scale concerns | |

**If No to most → not a buyer yet.**

---

## Category 2 — Decision Authority

| Signal | Y/N |
|--------|-----|
| Someone in the room owns outcomes (not just IT) | |
| They can influence budget or approval | |
| They ask "how soon" or "how does this roll out" | |

**If No → discovery only, no pricing.**

---

## Category 3 — Build vs Buy Maturity

| Signal | Y/N |
|--------|-----|
| They ask about timelines, not stacks | |
| They ask about governance boundaries | |
| They accept that some things are intentionally constrained | |

**If they keep pushing stack/schema/code → builder, not buyer.**

---

## Category 4 — Urgency Signals

| Signal | Y/N |
|--------|-----|
| They mention a program launch, funding deadline, or partner pressure | |
| They reference internal frustration or stalled initiatives | |
| They ask what it would take to start | |

**If No urgency → deprioritize.**

---

## Category 5 — Risk Posture

| Signal | Y/N |
|--------|-----|
| They care about auditability and failure modes | |
| They don't want staff workarounds | |
| They react positively to "admin-by-exception" | |

**If they downplay risk → likely to build and regret later.**

---

## How You Use the Scorecard

| Categories with YES | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| 4–5 | **Give pricing ranges** |
| 2–3 | Stay in fit/demo mode |
| 0–1 | Politely disengage |

---

## Your Exit Line

> "It sounds like you're still deciding whether to build or buy. When that's clearer, happy to reconnect."

**That preserves authority.**

## Quick Decision (30 Seconds After Call)

1. **Would I bet $1,000 they'll buy in 90 days?**
   - Yes → Send pricing
   - No → Why not? Fix that or move on.

2. **Did they ask about timing or did I have to bring it up?**
   - They asked → Real buyer
   - I brought it up → Tire kicker

3. **Can I name the specific program they'd launch first?**
   - Yes → Ready for pilot conversation
   - No → They're not serious yet

## The One Rule

**Never send pricing to someone who hasn't demonstrated problem fit.**

Pricing without context becomes a negotiation anchor against you.
Pricing with context becomes a decision tool for them.
