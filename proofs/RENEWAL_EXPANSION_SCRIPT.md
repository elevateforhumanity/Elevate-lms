# Renewal & Expansion Conversation Script

**Objective:** Make renewal inevitable and expansion logical
**Tone:** Calm, factual, non-urgent
**Rule:** You never "ask for renewal." You validate it.

Run this after the 90-Day Success Scorecard.

---

## Opening (Set the Frame — 2 Minutes)

Start exactly like this:

> "Today isn't a sales conversation."
> "It's a confirmation conversation."

*Pause.*

> "We're going to review what's now dependent on the system, what improved operationally, and what naturally comes next."

**This removes defensiveness immediately.**

---

## Step 1 — Confirm Dependency (The Anchor)

Ask this verbatim:

> "If the platform disappeared tomorrow, what would break first?"

**Do not interrupt. Let them answer fully.**

When they finish, summarize in their words:

> "So enrollment flow, credential issuance, and partner coordination would all stall."

Then say:

> "That tells us the platform is now operational infrastructure."

**This anchors renewal psychologically before pricing exists.**

---

## Step 2 — Name the Value (Without Numbers)

Say:

> "Since launch, three things have happened:"

Then list only what actually occurred (from the scorecard):

- Staff stopped tracking manually
- Certificates issue without intervention
- Students move without chasing
- Partners respond without follow-ups

Then this line:

> "Those are not features. Those are operating conditions."

*Pause.*

**This reframes renewal as protecting conditions, not buying software.**

---

## Step 3 — Normalize Renewal (Do Not Ask)

Say:

> "Given that dependency, renewal is straightforward."

*Pause.*

> "The only real decision is whether you want to keep operating at the current footprint—or expand intentionally."

**This removes the binary "renew or not" frame.**

---

## Step 4 — Introduce Expansion as Inevitable, Not Optional

Ask:

> "What's the next program or group that wants to come through this system?"

**Critical:** You are not proposing expansion. You are discovering pull.

When they answer, say:

> "That's the pattern we see consistently."
> "Once governance is stable, demand expands naturally."

---

## Step 5 — Frame Expansion as Risk Reduction

Say:

> "Expansion isn't about adding features."
> "It's about preventing the reintroduction of manual processes elsewhere."

Then this line (important):

> "Every program you keep outside the system becomes an operational exception."

**Executives understand this instantly.**

---

## Step 6 — Talk Pricing Without Negotiating

Only now mention cost.

Say:

> "At renewal, pricing simply reflects the footprint you're already running—plus anything you intentionally add."

*Pause.*

> "Nothing is repriced retroactively. There are no surprises."

If expansion is discussed:

> "We scope expansion the same way we scoped launch—controlled, deliberate, and governed."

**You never justify the number. You contextualize it.**

---

## Step 7 — Close Without Pressure

End with this:

> "From our side, the recommendation is to renew and plan expansion deliberately."

*Pause.*

> "Does that align with how you're thinking?"

**If they say yes:** Proceed.

**If they hesitate:**

> "What would need to be true for this to feel obvious?"

Then stop talking.

---

## If They Try to Re-Negotiate Hard

Respond calmly:

> "We're not pricing optional features."
> "We're pricing the operational footprint you now depend on."

Then silence.

**This resets leverage without escalation.**

---

## If They Say "We Need to Review Internally"

Say:

> "Of course."
> "Do you want me to summarize the dependency and expansion logic for that conversation, or would it help to join it?"

**You are offering support, not concession.**

---

## What This Script Does Psychologically

- Renewal becomes confirmation, not persuasion
- Expansion feels responsible, not opportunistic
- Pricing feels mechanical, not emotional
- Risk of churn is addressed without defensiveness
- You remain the authority on system behavior

---

## Final Rule

**If renewal feels hard, something upstream slipped:**
- Adoption
- Scope discipline
- Governance enforcement

This script does not fix weak value.
It reveals strong value cleanly.
