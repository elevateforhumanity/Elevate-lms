# EXHIBIT A

## PLATFORM SCOPE, OPERATING BOUNDARIES & CHANGE GOVERNANCE

This Exhibit is incorporated by reference into the Agreement and defines the operational scope, boundaries, and change governance applicable to the licensed platform ("Platform").

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Exhibit is to ensure predictable operation, auditability, and long-term stability of the Platform by clearly defining what is included in the licensed scope, what is excluded, and how changes are evaluated and implemented.

**These boundaries are material to performance and risk management.**

---

## 2. Included Scope ("In-Scope Services")

Provider shall provide and maintain a licensed Platform that:

### 2.1 Enforces Governed Lifecycles

The Platform enforces distinct, deterministic lifecycle stages, including but not limited to:
- enrollment,
- eligibility and approval,
- document intake and review,
- program completion,
- credential issuance, and
- system-generated notifications.

### 2.2 Operates as System-Directed

The Platform is designed so that actions taken by users reliably produce defined outcomes without reliance on manual intervention, except where judgment is required.

### 2.3 Supports Institution-Specific Configuration

The Platform supports configuration of institution-specific elements, including:
- programs and offerings,
- branding and communications,
- eligibility and funding rules,
- partner relationships, and
- credential naming and structures.

### 2.4 Admin-by-Exception Operations

Administrative users intervene by approval or exception handling; routine progression is system-directed.

---

## 3. Excluded Scope ("Out-of-Scope Services")

Unless expressly agreed in writing, the following are excluded from the licensed scope:

### 3.1 Ad Hoc Core Lifecycle Modifications

Provider shall not modify core lifecycle logic:
- on a per-program basis,
- mid-launch or mid-cohort,
- or in response to one-off operational requests.

### 3.2 Parallel Manual Workflows

Provider does not support or warrant outcomes resulting from parallel manual processes operated outside the Platform for in-scope programs.

### 3.3 Bespoke Development Services

The Platform is licensed software and is not a custom development engagement. Requests requiring forking or duplicating core logic are excluded unless separately contracted.

### 3.4 Program Ownership and Delivery

Client retains responsibility for curriculum, instruction, staffing, and program delivery. Provider supplies the operational platform only.

---

## 4. Change Governance

All change requests are categorized as follows:

### 4.1 Configuration Changes

Changes to supported configuration parameters are in-scope and may be implemented without modification to core lifecycle logic.

### 4.2 Extensions

New features or capabilities that extend Platform functionality without altering core lifecycle enforcement may be evaluated, scoped, and scheduled subject to mutual agreement.

### 4.3 Core Lifecycle Changes

Changes that alter enrollment, completion, credentialing, or other governed lifecycle stages are strategic in nature and will be evaluated separately. Such changes are not implemented on an expedited or ad hoc basis.

---

## 5. Operational Integrity

### 5.1 Stability Priority

Operational stability, auditability, and determinism take precedence over convenience or speed of change.

### 5.2 No Waiver by Practice

Failure to enforce a boundary on any occasion does not constitute a waiver of that boundary.

---

## 6. Acknowledgement

By executing the Agreement, Client acknowledges that:
- these boundaries are intended to reduce operational risk,
- deviations increase complexity and audit exposure, and
- adherence to this Exhibit is necessary for predictable outcomes.

## How to Use This

When legal asks, say:

> "This exhibit exists so neither side has to renegotiate scope every time someone asks for an exception."

Then stop talking.

**Legal teams accept this because:**
- It defines scope cleanly
- It limits implied obligations
- It protects both parties
