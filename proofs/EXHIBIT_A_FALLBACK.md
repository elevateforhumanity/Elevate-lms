## Platform Scope, Operating Boundaries & Change Governance

*Procurement-Softened, Risk-Preserving*

> **Use only if legal/procurement pushes back on rigidity.**
> This version concedes language tone, not authority.

## 1. Purpose

This Exhibit defines the operational scope and change governance applicable to the licensed platform ("Platform") in order to support predictable operation, reasonable flexibility, and audit-aware implementation.

---

## 2. In-Scope Services

Provider shall provide a licensed Platform that supports:

### 2.1 Managed Operational Lifecycles

The Platform supports structured workflows for enrollment, approvals, document handling, program completion, credential issuance, and system notifications.

### 2.2 System-Guided Progression

The Platform is designed to guide users through defined workflows, with administrative intervention as appropriate.

### 2.3 Institutional Configuration

The Platform supports configuration of programs, branding, communications, eligibility rules, partners, and credential definitions.

---

## 3. Out-of-Scope Services

Unless mutually agreed in writing, the following are excluded:

### 3.1 Unscoped Core Workflow Alterations

Material changes to core operational workflows will be evaluated separately and are not guaranteed to be implemented within standard timelines.

### 3.2 Unsupported External Processes

Provider is not responsible for outcomes arising from manual or external processes operated outside the Platform.

### 3.3 Custom Development

The Platform is licensed software. Custom development services require separate agreement.

### 3.4 Program Delivery

Client retains responsibility for instructional content, staffing, and program delivery.

---

## 4. Change Management

Changes are categorized as:

| Category | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Configuration Adjustments** | Supported within the Platform's design |
| **Functional Extensions** | Subject to review and agreement |
| **Material Workflow Changes** | Evaluated separately based on impact and feasibility |

Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to assess requested changes.

---

## 5. Operational Considerations

Operational consistency and reporting integrity are prioritized.
Temporary deviations do not constitute permanent scope expansion.

---

## 6. Acknowledgement

Both parties acknowledge that clarity of scope supports efficient implementation and reduces operational risk.

---

## Why This Version Works

Procurement hears "reasonable," "commercially reasonable efforts," and "flexibility."

**You still retain control of the lifecycle.**
