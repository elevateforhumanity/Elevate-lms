# Clean Transition Into Pricing

---

## When to Transition

After:
- Your 90-second script, AND
- 1–2 follow-up answers

Not before. Not later.

## Primary Transition Line (Use Most Often)

"At this point, the only remaining question is scope and scale."
If this governance model works for you, pricing is simply about how many programs, learners, and partners you want to run through it.

*Pause.*

"Would it be helpful to walk through what that typically looks like?"

**This frames pricing as configuration, not negotiation.**

---

## If They Ask "What Does It Cost?" Directly

**Your response:**
"It depends on operational footprint, not features."
Institutions pay based on how much of the system they're running—programs, learners, credentials, partners—not on checkboxes.

"If you're open to it, I can outline the ranges based on similar institutions."

*Then stop.*

## If They Hesitate or Go Quiet

**Your response:**
"Totally fine if today is just about fit."
If this solves the right problem, pricing is straightforward. If it doesn't, there's no number that makes sense.

**That sentence filters without pressure.**

## If They Say "We Need Budget Approval"

**Your response:**
"That's common."
What usually helps is anchoring the decision on avoided build time, avoided headcount, and avoided risk—not line items.

"I can give you something clean to take back internally."

*This tees up the written brief.*

## How This All Flows Together

1. **90-second script** reframes the decision
2. **Follow-up answers** narrow the aperture
3. **Deflection lines** prevent derailment
4. **Pricing transition** happens naturally because the value frame is already set

You are never selling.
You are letting them decide where they want to spend risk.
