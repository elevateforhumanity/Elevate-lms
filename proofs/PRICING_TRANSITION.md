# Demo → Pricing Handoff (Clean, Controlled)

This is where most people lose leverage. You won't.

---

## When to Transition

After:
- The exec demo, OR
- The full 10-minute demo

Once they nod, pause, or say "this makes sense."

---

## Primary Handoff Line (Use Most Often)

> "At this point, the only remaining variable is scale."

*Pause.*

> "Pricing is based on how much of the system you're running—programs, learners, credentials, and partners—not on feature checklists."

*Pause again.*

> "Would it be helpful to walk through what that typically looks like?"

**This reframes pricing as capacity, not negotiation.**

---

## If They Ask "What Does It Cost?" Bluntly

**Your answer:**

> "It depends on operational footprint, not features."
> Institutions pay based on how many programs, learners, and credentials they're running—not on toggles.

> "I can give you realistic ranges based on similar institutions."

*Stop there.*

---

## If They Say "We Need to Take This Back Internally"

**Your response:**

> "That's normal."
> What usually helps is framing this around avoided build time, avoided headcount, and avoided risk—not software cost.

> "I'll leave you something clean that helps with that conversation."

*(That's where your written brief does the work for you.)*

## If They Hesitate or Go Quiet

**You say:**

> "If today is just about fit, that's fine."
> If the governance model fits, pricing is straightforward. If it doesn't, there's no number that makes sense.

*Silence after that is your friend.*

## How This All Fits Together (Mental Map)

1. **90-second script** kills the "we'll build it" objection
2. **Follow-ups** narrow scope without tangents
3. **5-minute exec demo** proves control
4. **10-minute full demo** proves depth
5. **Pricing handoff** happens naturally because value is already anchored

You are not convincing.
You are letting them self-select.
