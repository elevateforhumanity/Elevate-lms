# Pricing Framework (Ranges + Rationale)

This is not a price list. This is how you anchor value and prevent feature-by-feature haggling.

---

## How You Introduce Pricing (Verbatim)

> "We don't price by features. We price by operational footprint."
> That keeps pricing aligned to real usage and real risk—not checkboxes.

Then show the framework.

## The Three Pricing Dimensions (Non-Negotiable)

Pricing is driven by how much of the system you run:

### 1. Programs
- Number of active programs (by lifecycle, not just listings)
- Different governance paths count as separate programs

### 2. Learners
- Annual active learners moving through the lifecycle
- Not total users, not logins—active participants

### 3. Credentials / Outcomes
- Certificates or credentials issued annually
- This matters because credentialing carries compliance and audit weight

**Partners are a modifier, not a base dimension.**

## Pricing Bands (Typical Ranges)

Present these as typical ranges, not offers.

### Tier 1 — Pilot / Single Program

**Who it's for:** One or two programs, controlled rollout, internal proof.

- 1–2 programs
- Up to ~250 learners/year
- Limited partner involvement

**Typical annual range:** Low five figures ($15K–$30K)

**Language you use:**
> "This tier is about proving fit without overcommitting."

---

### Tier 2 — Multi-Program Institution

**Who it's for:** Departments, workforce divisions, regional initiatives.

- 3–10 programs
- Hundreds to a few thousand learners/year
- Multiple partners or funding paths

**Typical annual range:** Mid five figures ($40K–$75K)

**Language you use:**
> "This is where institutions stop managing manually and start operating."

---

### Tier 3 — Enterprise / System-Wide

**Who it's for:** Districts, systems, statewide initiatives, large nonprofits.

- 10+ programs
- Thousands of learners/year
- Complex funding, partner networks

**Typical annual range:** High five to low six figures ($80K–$150K+)

**Language you use:**
> "This replaces internal builds and permanent operational headcount."

---

## What You Never Say

**Do NOT say:**
- "It depends" without context
- "We'll customize pricing later"
- "We're flexible"

**Instead say:**
> "Once we know your footprint, pricing becomes mechanical."

Then stop.

## Negotiation Anchors

**If they push on price:**
> "The pilot tier exists to prove value before commitment. If it works, you scale. If it doesn't, you've spent less than one month of a junior developer's salary."

**If they want features not in their tier:**
> "That's available in the next tier. Or we can scope it as a one-time add-on."

**If they want to pay per student:**
> "We don't do per-seat because it penalizes growth. You should be able to scale enrollment without renegotiating price every quarter."

## Discounts (Use Sparingly)

| Scenario | Discount |
|----------|----------|
| Annual prepay | 2 months free (16% effective) |
| Multi-year (2+ years) | 20% off annual rate |
| Nonprofit / community college | 25% off (requires verification) |
| Case study / reference agreement | 10% off first year |

**Never discount more than 30% total.** If they need more, they're not a buyer.

---

## What You're Actually Selling

Not features. Not seats. Not storage.

- **Speed:** Programs launch in days, not months
- **Risk transfer:** You don't own the failure modes
- **Operational clarity:** Staff work on exceptions, not workflows
- **Audit readiness:** Deterministic outcomes, reproducible reports

Price accordingly.
