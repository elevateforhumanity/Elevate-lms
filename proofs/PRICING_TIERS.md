# Licensing & Pricing Tiers

---

## Pricing Philosophy

Price on **value delivered**, not features consumed.

Value = (students served) × (programs offered) × (risk transferred)

Do not price per feature. Do not price per seat for staff.

## Negotiation Anchors

**If they push on price:**
"The pilot tier exists to prove value before commitment. If it works, you scale. If it doesn't, you've spent less than one month of a junior developer's salary."

**If they want features not in their tier:**
"That's available in [next tier]. Or we can scope it as a one-time add-on if you want to stay at current tier."

**If they want to pay per student:**
"We don't do per-seat because it penalizes growth. You should be able to scale enrollment without renegotiating price every quarter."

---

## Discounts (Use Sparingly)

| Scenario | Discount |
|----------|----------|
| Annual prepay | 2 months free (16% effective) |
| Multi-year (2+ years) | 20% off annual rate |
| Nonprofit / community college | 25% off (requires verification) |
| Case study / reference agreement | 10% off first year |

Never discount more than 30% total. If they need more, they're not a buyer.

---

## Closing Language

"The pilot is designed to prove value in 90 days. If it works, we talk about scaling. If it doesn't, you've validated that quickly and cheaply. Either way, you have clarity."

---

## What You're Actually Selling

Not features. Not seats. Not storage.

You're selling:
- **Speed:** Programs launch in days, not months
- **Risk transfer:** You don't own the failure modes
- **Operational clarity:** Staff work on exceptions, not workflows
- **Audit readiness:** Deterministic outcomes, reproducible reports

Price accordingly.
