# Post-Approval Onboarding Script

Run this within 48 hours of approval. Do not delay.
This script protects momentum, scope, and authority.

---

## Purpose (Say This First)

> "Now that approval is in place, the goal is a clean, controlled launch."
> "This onboarding is designed to get you live quickly without introducing operational risk."

**That sentence sets expectations: speed + discipline.**

---

## Step 1 — Confirm the Launch Shape (10–15 minutes)

Ask these in order. Do not solve yet.

1. **Which programs are launching first?**
   (Limit to 1–2. If they say more, respond below.)

2. **Which learner groups are in scope for launch?**
   (New learners only vs. mixed cohorts.)

3. **Are there funding or eligibility rules tied to these programs?**
   (Yes/No. Details come later.)

4. **Are partners involved at launch?**
   (If yes, name them. No new partners mid-launch.)

**If they try to expand scope:**
> "For launch, we lock scope. Expansion comes after stability."

Then move on.

---

## Step 2 — Set the Non-Negotiable Rules (Critical)

Say this verbatim or close:

> "For the first launch window, we do not customize the governed core."
> Programs, branding, and configurations are in scope.
> Lifecycle logic is not.

> "This ensures your first cohort moves end-to-end without surprises."

*Pause. Let them agree.*

**If they push back:**
> "We can absolutely extend later. We don't do it mid-launch."

---

## Step 3 — Define Roles (Who Does What)

Establish clear ownership immediately.

**Say:**
> "You own program decisions." (content, requirements, partners)
> "We own lifecycle enforcement." (enrollment → completion → credentialing)
> "Staff intervene by exception, not by default."

**Then confirm:**
> "Who is the single decision-maker for launch approvals?"

**If they name a committee:**
> "We'll need one accountable owner to keep momentum."

---

## Step 4 — Lock the Launch Checklist (No Surprises)

Walk through this quickly.

**For launch readiness, we require:**
- [ ] Program names and descriptions finalized
- [ ] Enrollment criteria confirmed
- [ ] Document requirements listed
- [ ] Credential names approved
- [ ] Staff reviewers identified
- [ ] Partner contacts confirmed (if applicable)

**Add:**
> "If any of these are missing, launch pauses—not partially launches."

**This prevents half-live chaos.**

---

## Step 5 — Set the Launch Timeline (Keeps Control)

**Frame it like this:**
> "Once inputs are complete, launch is measured in days, not weeks."

**Define the rhythm:**
1. Configuration window
2. Internal verification
3. Pilot cohort
4. Full cohort

**Do not give dates yet unless inputs are ready.**

---

## Step 6 — Set Expectations for Change Requests

**Say this clearly:**
> "During the first cohort, changes are logged—not implemented immediately."
> We stabilize first. Then we extend intentionally.

**If they ask "why":**
> "Because mid-stream changes create exceptions. Exceptions are what break systems."

End of discussion.

---

## Step 7 — Close with Confidence

**End onboarding with this:**
> "If we follow this process, you'll see students enroll, progress, complete, and receive credentials without staff chasing anything."

**Then:**
> "Our job is to make the system boring."

**That line lands.**

## What This Script Prevents

- Scope creep disguised as urgency
- Committees slowing execution
- Mid-launch customization requests
- Staff reverting to manual processes
- Blame shifting when timelines slip

---

## How You Use This in Practice

1. Run this as a 30–45 minute kickoff call
2. Share a written summary **after**, not before
3. Treat agreement to this flow as the real "go-live" decision

**If a buyer resists this structure, they are not ready to launch.**
That's not a failure—it's protection.
