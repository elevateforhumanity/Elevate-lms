# Operational Boundaries for Agency Deployment

**State / Government Agency Version**

**Purpose:** To ensure continuity, audit defensibility, and long-term stability across administrations, the platform enforces strict operational boundaries.

---

## What We Do (Agency Context)

- Operate as a system of record
- Enforce lifecycle determinism (no ambiguity)
- Maintain reproducible reporting
- Reduce dependence on individual staff knowledge
- Support multi-program, multi-partner governance

---

## What You Control

- Program policy and eligibility rules
- Partner participation
- Credential frameworks
- Internal approval processes
- Oversight and compliance decisions

---

## What We Don't Do (Critical for Agencies)

- We do not permit policy exceptions via technical shortcuts
- We do not customize core workflows per program
- We do not rely on manual controls for compliance
- We do not implement changes mid-stream

**These constraints ensure defensibility under review.**
