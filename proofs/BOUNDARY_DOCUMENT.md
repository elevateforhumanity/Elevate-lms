# What We Do / What We Don't Do

**Platform Boundaries & Operating Principles**

**Purpose:** To ensure fast launches, predictable outcomes, and long-term stability, we are explicit about what the platform is responsible for—and what it is not.

This protects both sides.

---

## WHAT WE DO

### 1. We Provide a Governed Operational Core

We deliver a production-ready system that enforces:
- enrollment lifecycles,
- eligibility and approval paths,
- document intake and review,
- program completion,
- credential issuance,
- and automated notifications.

**These workflows are deterministic: actions reliably produce outcomes.**

---

### 2. We Enforce Lifecycle Boundaries

The platform intentionally separates:
- enrollment,
- training,
- completion,
- and credentialing.

**This separation is what makes the system auditable, scalable, and safe to operate over time.**

---

### 3. We Support Institution-Specific Configuration

You control:
- programs and offerings,
- branding and communications,
- funding and eligibility rules,
- partner relationships,
- credential names and structures.

**These are expected points of variation and are designed to be configurable.**

---

### 4. We Design for Admin-by-Exception Operations

The system moves forward automatically.
Staff intervene only when judgment is required.

**This reduces operational drag and long-term staffing burden.**

---

### 5. We Support Safe, Intentional Extension

When needs evolve, we support:
- controlled extensions,
- feature-flagged changes,
- and scoped enhancements.

**Changes are deliberate—not accidental.**

---

## WHAT WE DON'T DO

### 1. We Do Not Customize the Governed Core Ad Hoc

We do not modify core lifecycle logic:
- mid-launch,
- per program,
- or in response to one-off requests.

**This is how systems break and exceptions become permanent.**

---

### 2. We Do Not Support Parallel Manual Workflows

Running some programs "inside the system" and others manually undermines governance.

**If a process matters, it belongs in the platform.**

---

### 3. We Do Not Replace Program Ownership

You own:
- curriculum,
- instructional delivery,
- staffing,
- and program outcomes.

**We provide the operational machinery—not program management.**

---

### 4. We Do Not Operate as a Custom Development Shop

This is a licensed platform, not a bespoke build.

**Requests that require forking core logic or creating institution-specific versions are evaluated separately and intentionally.**

---

### 5. We Do Not Optimize for Convenience Over Governance

Some constraints are intentional.

They exist to prevent:
- audit risk,
- reporting disputes,
- manual workarounds,
- and long-term instability.

---

## HOW CHANGES ARE HANDLED

All change requests fall into one of three categories:

| Category | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Configuration** | Supported immediately |
| **Extension** | Scoped, reviewed, and scheduled |
| **Core Lifecycle Change** | Evaluated strategically. Never rushed. |

**This ensures predictability for both parties.**

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

- Faster launches
- Fewer surprises
- Clear ownership
- Stable operations
- Easier renewals and expansions

**And most importantly: No accidental complexity.**

---

## How to Introduce This

Say:

> "This isn't a limitation document—it's a stability document."
> "When everyone agrees to these boundaries, implementations move quickly and stay clean."

Then stop talking.

---

## Final Note

If a buyer resists this document, they are signaling one of two things:
1. They want bespoke development, or
2. They are not ready for governed operations.

**Either way, this document saves you months.**
