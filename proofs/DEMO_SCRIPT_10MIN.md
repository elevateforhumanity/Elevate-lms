# The 10-Minute License Demo (Buyer-Safe, Deal-Closing)

This is not a product tour. This is a decision demo.
You are not trying to impress. You are letting the system speak for itself.

---

## Minute 0–1: Set the Frame (Critical)

Open with this, calmly:

> "I'm not going to walk you through features. I'm going to show you how the system behaves when real people use it."
> "If this behavior matches how you operate, we keep talking. If it doesn't, we stop."

**This positions you as confident and non-defensive.**

---

## Minute 1–3: Student Entry → Governance (NOT Content)

**Show:** Programs → Enrollment start (any program)

**Say:**
> "Students don't just sign up. They enter a governed lifecycle."
> Enrollment here is tied to funding paths, approvals, documentation, and outcomes—not just access to content.

**Do NOT explain:**
- No stack
- No schema
- No feature list

**Why this works:** Buyers immediately see this is not a generic LMS.

---

## Minute 3–5: Student Dashboard → State Machine (This Is the Hook)

**Navigate to:** `/lms/dashboard`

**Say (slowly):**
> "This dashboard isn't content-driven. It's state-driven."

**Point out:**
- Dominant action
- Locked sections with reasons
- Progress tied to lifecycle state

**Then say the most important line in the entire demo:**

> "The system decides what the student should do next."

*Pause.*

**Why this matters:** This reframes the platform as an operational system, not a teaching tool.

---

## Minute 5–6: Document Upload → Staff Automation

**Navigate to:** `/apprentice/documents`

**Say:**
> "Students upload required documents directly."
> "The moment they do, staff are notified automatically."

**Do NOT show the email unless asked.**

**Add:**
> "There are no silent queues. Uploads create operational signals."

**Why this matters:** This kills the "our staff will manage it" illusion buyers often have.

---

## Minute 6–8: Completion → Certificate (The Trust Moment)

**Slow down here.**

**Say:**
> "This is where most systems break."

**Then explain clearly:**
- Enrollment ≠ training ≠ credential
- Completion is a governed event
- Certificates are issued automatically on completion

**Key line (do not skip):**
> "No one issues certificates by hand unless something goes wrong."

**If you show or reference the completion flow:**
> "Completion triggers credential issuance and delivery immediately. It's idempotent—retries don't create duplicates."

*Pause again.*

**Why this matters:** This addresses compliance, audits, and credibility in one stroke.

---

## Minute 8–9: Admin & Partner View (Exception-Only Control)

**Show:** Admin area briefly

**Say:**
> "Admins approve, review, or intervene by exception."
> "Partners are notified automatically when they need to act."

**Then this line:**
> "No one needs to 'check on things' for the system to move forward."

**That sentence lands hard.**

---

## Minute 9–10: Close Without Selling

**End with this:**

> "That's the system."
> "It's already running live."

**Then:**

> "The question isn't whether this can be built."
> "It's whether you want to own this complexity—or operate on top of it."

*Stop talking.*

---

## If They Ask Questions During the Demo

**Rules:**
- One answer, then stop
- Never pivot screens reactively
- Never open code

**If they interrupt:**
> "I'll answer that in one sentence, then keep moving."

**That keeps control.**

## What This Demo Does (Without You Saying It)

- Shows governance without explaining governance
- Proves automation without claiming automation
- Demonstrates maturity without buzzwords
- Filters builders from buyers naturally

If they ask about pricing after this demo, you're in a strong position.
If they don't, they were never buying.
