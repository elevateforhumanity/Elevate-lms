## ⏳ Pending Items

### 1. DNS Propagation (1-24 hours)
**Status:** In progress

**What's happening:**
- DNS changes propagating globally
- Some regions may see old site
- Some regions may see new site
- This is normal during propagation

**Check status:**
- [https://www.whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
- Enter: elevateforhumanity.institute
- Look for: 75.2.60.5

### 2. SSL Certificates (Automatic)
**Status:** Will be issued after DNS propagates

**Timeline:**
- DNS propagates: 1-24 hours
- SSL issued: 1-2 hours after DNS
- Total: 2-26 hours

### 3. Build Issues (Non-blocking)
**Status:** Recent commits failing to build

**Impact:** None - older working version is live

**Note:** The site is running on a stable commit (ca6168c6). Recent documentation commits are failing to build, but this doesn't affect the live site.

**Action:** Can be fixed later, not urgent
