# 30-Day Scope Freeze

**Effective Date:** January 19, 2025
**End Date:** February 18, 2025

## Purpose

This document establishes a 30-day scope freeze to stabilize the Elevate for Humanity platform. During this period, no new features, programs, or flows will be added.

## What IS Allowed

- Bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Broken link fixes
- Security patches
- Performance optimizations
- Wording/copy improvements
- Redirect fixes

## What is NOT Allowed

- New programs
