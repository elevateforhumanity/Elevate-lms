**Subject:** Employer-Sponsored Training Partnership Opportunity

---

Hello,

Elevate for Humanity partners with employers to reduce hiring risk and shorten onboarding time through structured pre-employment training.

We prepare candidates with job-ready skills before hire, then offer an employer-sponsored tuition reimbursement model tied to retention.

**How it works:**
- We train and screen candidates
- You hire qualified graduates
- Tuition is reimbursed after hire through a simple monthly schedule
- Payments stop if employment ends

**Why employers partner with us:**
- Reduced onboarding costs
- Faster time-to-productivity
- Improved retention
- No upfront training expense

We are opening a limited number of sponsored seats for upcoming cohorts and would welcome a brief conversation to explore alignment.

Best regards,  
Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

## Talk Track (Phone/Meeting)

> "We train candidates before you hire them. You only pay after they're on your payroll, spread over 12–20 months. If they leave, payments stop. No risk, no upfront cost, and you get employees who are already trained to your industry standards."
