# Admissions Intake Checklist
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — REQUIRED FOR ALL ADMISSIONS STAFF**

**Version:** 1.0 - FINAL  
**Effective:** January 2025

---

## Purpose

To determine the correct funding pathway and enrollment readiness **before** acceptance, payment discussion, or program start.

**Nothing else happens until intake is complete.**

---

## STEP 1: Identity and Eligibility Verification (Required)

Staff must collect and verify:

- [ ] Government-issued photo ID
- [ ] Proof of residency (state-specific if required)
- [ ] Age eligibility (program minimums)
- [ ] Legal name and contact information
- [ ] Employment status (employed, unemployed, underemployed)

**No funding conversation occurs until identity is confirmed.**

---

## STEP 2: Workforce Funding Screening (First Priority)

Staff must ask and document:

- [ ] Are you currently working with a workforce agency or career navigator?
- [ ] Have you received WIOA, VR, or workforce funding in the past?
- [ ] Are you currently unemployed, dislocated, or underemployed?
- [ ] Do you receive public assistance or disability-related services?
- [ ] Have you been justice-involved or recently re-entered the workforce?

**If any answer suggests eligibility:**
→ Student is routed to workforce funding review  
→ Admissions pauses payment discussion  
→ Referral documentation is initiated

---

## STEP 3: Employer Sponsorship Screening (Second Priority)

Staff must ask:

- [ ] Are you currently employed?
- [ ] Does your employer offer tuition reimbursement or training support?
- [ ] Are you willing to pursue employer-sponsored placement after training?
- [ ] Are you open to employer partner referral upon completion?

**If yes:**
→ Student is flagged for employer pathway  
→ Employer verification process begins  
→ Student is not offered internal tuition until this lane is exhausted

---

## STEP 4: Financial Readiness Check (Not a Credit Check)

**This is not judgment. It is alignment.**

Staff must confirm:

- [ ] Ability to provide $500 initial payment
- [ ] Ability to commit to $200/month for three months
- [ ] Willingness to use automatic payment
- [ ] Understanding that internal plans end at 90 days

**If any item is declined:**
→ Student is not eligible for internal tuition  
→ Student is routed back to workforce/employer review or advised to wait

---

## STEP 5: Program Readiness Confirmation

Staff must verify:

- [ ] Program start date availability
- [ ] Attendance requirements understood
- [ ] Technology access confirmed (if applicable)
- [ ] Time commitment acknowledged
- [ ] Outcome expectations explained (completion ≠ guaranteed job)

**This protects outcomes and refund disputes.**

---

## STEP 6: Funding Pathway Assignment (One Only)

Staff assigns **one** pathway:

- [ ] Workforce-Funded
- [ ] Employer-Sponsored
- [ ] Structured Student Tuition (Bridge Plan)

**No student may be listed under multiple pathways.**

---

## STEP 7: Documentation and Acknowledgment

Before enrollment, student must sign acknowledgment confirming:

- [ ] Funding pathway assigned
- [ ] Payment structure understood
- [ ] No verbal exceptions exist
- [ ] Completion credentials require good standing

**Unsigned intake = no enrollment.**

---

## STEP 8: Enrollment Authorization

**Only after intake is complete** may staff:

- [ ] Collect payment
- [ ] Issue login credentials
- [ ] Schedule orientation
- [ ] Grant program access

**Skipping intake invalidates enrollment approval.**

---

## Internal Rules (Non-Negotiable)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Intake is not sales | Do not sell during intake |
| Funding is decided before emotion | No excitement until pathway is confirmed |
| No staff member overrides intake | No exceptions without executive approval |
| Exceptions require written approval | Verbal approvals do not exist |
| "We'll figure it out later" is prohibited | This phrase is a policy violation |

---

## Intake Completion Checklist

Before marking intake complete, verify:

- [ ] Step 1: Identity verified
- [ ] Step 2: Workforce screening completed
- [ ] Step 3: Employer screening completed
- [ ] Step 4: Financial readiness confirmed (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 5: Program readiness confirmed
- [ ] Step 6: Single funding pathway assigned
- [ ] Step 7: Acknowledgment signed
- [ ] Step 8: Ready for enrollment authorization

**All boxes must be checked. Incomplete intake = no enrollment.**

---

## Final Reality Check

If a student cannot pass intake, the problem is not affordability.

**It is timing, alignment, or readiness.**

Strong institutions do not enroll everyone.  
They enroll the right students, the right way.

*This checklist is mandatory. Skipping steps or overriding without written executive approval is a policy violation subject to disciplinary action.*
