# Internal Tuition Collection Policy
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — NOT FOR STUDENT DISTRIBUTION**

**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Approved By:** Executive Director  
**Version:** 1.0 - FINAL

---

## Purpose

This policy governs tuition collection for students who are NOT covered by:
- WIOA or other workforce funding
- Employer sponsorship
- Grant programs

This policy exists to protect the institution from uncollected tuition while providing a fair pathway for self-paying students.

---

## Core Principle

**Elevate for Humanity is not a lender.**

We do not extend credit. We do not make loans. Internal payment plans are structured tuition payments for training access, not financing arrangements.

All marketing, enrollment conversations, and documentation must reflect this distinction.

---

## Payment Options (In Order of Preference)

### 1. Third-Party Financing (PREFERRED)
- **Providers:** Affirm, Klarna
- **How it works:** Student applies at checkout, provider approves, we receive payment upfront
- **Default risk:** Carried by provider, NOT by us
- **Staff action:** Always offer this first

### 2. Pay in Full
- **When:** At enrollment
- **Methods:** Credit card, debit card, ACH bank transfer
- **Staff action:** Process immediately

### 3. Internal Payment Plan (LAST RESORT)
- **Use only when:** Options 1 and 2 are not viable
- **Terms:** See below — NO EXCEPTIONS

---

## Internal Payment Plan Terms

These terms are FIXED. Staff may not negotiate, modify, or make exceptions without written Executive Director approval.

| Term | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum Down Payment** | 20% of tuition OR $500, whichever is greater |
| **Maximum Term** | 6 months — NO LONGER |
| **Payment Method** | Autopay ONLY — no manual payments accepted |
| **Payment Frequency** | Monthly |
| **Late Fee** | $50 per missed payment |
| **Grace Period** | 7 days from due date |

### Enforcement (Automatic — No Exceptions)

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Payment fails | Student notified, 7-day grace period begins |
| Grace period expires | **Academic pause** — no course access, no lab access |
| 2nd missed payment | Enrollment termination review |
| Balance > $0 at completion | **Credential hold** — no certificates, transcripts, or letters released |
