# Internal Tuition Collection Policy
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — NOT FOR STUDENT DISTRIBUTION**

**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Approved By:** Executive Director  
**Version:** 1.0 - FINAL

---

## Purpose

This policy governs tuition collection for students who are NOT covered by:
- WIOA or other workforce funding
- Employer sponsorship
- Grant programs

This policy exists to protect the institution from uncollected tuition while providing a fair pathway for self-paying students.

---

## Core Principle

**Elevate for Humanity is not a lender.**

We do not extend credit. We do not make loans. Internal payment plans are structured tuition payments for training access, not financing arrangements.

All marketing, enrollment conversations, and documentation must reflect this distinction.

---

## Payment Options (In Order of Preference)

### 1. Third-Party Financing (PREFERRED)
- **Providers:** Affirm, Klarna
- **How it works:** Student applies at checkout, provider approves, we receive payment upfront
- **Default risk:** Carried by provider, NOT by us
- **Staff action:** Always offer this first

### 2. Pay in Full
- **When:** At enrollment
- **Methods:** Credit card, debit card, ACH bank transfer
- **Staff action:** Process immediately

### 3. Internal Payment Plan (LAST RESORT)
- **Use only when:** Options 1 and 2 are not viable
- **Terms:** See below — NO EXCEPTIONS

---

## Internal Payment Plan Terms

### Lane 3A: Bridge Plan (Internal — 90 Days Maximum)

This is a **bridge**, not a long-term solution. It gets the student started while transitioning to a permanent payor.

| Term | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Down Payment** | $500 (fixed) |
| **Monthly Payment** | $200 minimum |
| **Maximum Term** | 3 months (90 days) — **HARD STOP** |
| **Total Collected Internally** | $1,100 maximum ($500 + $200×3) |
| **Payment Method** | Autopay ONLY |
| **Late Fee** | $50 per missed payment |
| **Grace Period** | 7 days from due date |

### Day 90 Transition Requirement

At Day 90, the student MUST transition to one of:
1. Employer reimbursement
2. Third-party financing (Affirm/Klarna)
3. Pay remaining balance in full

**No extensions. No renegotiation. No exceptions.**

### Lane 3B: Long-Term Payments (External Only)

For any payment need that requires:
- Monthly payments below $200, OR
- Terms beyond 90 days

**Elevate for Humanity does NOT carry these balances.**

Student must use:
- Third-party financing (Affirm/Klarna)
- Employer sponsorship

### Enforcement (Automatic — No Exceptions)

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Payment fails | Student notified, 7-day grace period begins |
| Grace period expires | **Academic pause** — no course access, no lab access |
| 2nd missed payment | Enrollment termination review |
| Day 90 without transition | **Academic pause** until transition secured |
| Balance > $0 at completion | **Credential hold** — no certificates, transcripts, or letters released |

## Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules are protective, not punitive.

1. ❌ **No internal plans longer than 90 days**
2. ❌ **No internal payments below $200/month**
3. ❌ **No verbal exceptions**
4. ❌ **No credential release with outstanding balance**
5. ❌ Waive or reduce $500 down payment
6. ❌ Accept manual payments instead of autopay
7. ❌ Extend bridge plan beyond Day 90
8. ❌ Enroll without secured funding or signed payment agreement
9. ❌ Make "hardship" exceptions without documentation

**Violation of this policy is grounds for disciplinary action.**

## Reality Check for Staff

Students who truly can only afford $100/month are not ready for a $5,000 program unless another payor exists.

That is not judgment—it is financial alignment.

Your job is **access with structure**, not access at any cost.

---

## Required Documentation

Before processing an internal payment plan, staff must obtain:

- [ ] Signed Enrollment Agreement
- [ ] Signed Payment Plan Agreement
- [ ] Signed Autopay Authorization

All documents must be stored in the student's file and the LMS.
