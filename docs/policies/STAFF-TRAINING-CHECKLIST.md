# Admissions Staff Training & Enforcement Checklist
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — REQUIRED FOR ALL ADMISSIONS STAFF**

**Version:** 1.0 - FINAL  
**Effective:** January 2025  
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly and after every new hire

---

## Purpose

To ensure consistent, compliant, and disciplined execution of admissions, funding pathways, and enrollment decisions across all staff.

---

## SECTION 1: Required Knowledge (Staff Must Demonstrate)

Staff must be able to explain, **without notes**:

- [ ] The three funding pathways
- [ ] The priority order of pathways
- [ ] Why workforce and employer funding come before tuition
- [ ] The internal bridge plan structure
- [ ] The 90-day hard stop rule
- [ ] Why long-term internal payment plans are prohibited

**If a staff member cannot explain this clearly, they do not conduct admissions.**

---

## SECTION 2: Language Control (Script Adherence)

**Staff must use:**
- Approved admissions script only
- Neutral, confident tone
- Clear numbers stated once
- No speculative language

**Staff may not use:**
- "Maybe"
- "Possibly"
- "Let me see what I can do"
- "We've made exceptions before"
- "We'll figure it out later"

**Any deviation is corrected immediately.**

---

## SECTION 3: Objection Handling (Locked Responses Only)

Staff must respond **exactly as trained** when hearing:

### "I can only do $100 a month."
→ "At that level, a long-term payor is required. We would need to explore workforce funding, employer sponsorship, or external financing."

### "Other schools let me pay less."
→ "Each institution structures tuition differently. Our model is designed to support completion and stability."

### "Can you make an exception?"
→ "Our funding pathways are standardized. Exceptions are not handled at the admissions level."

**No alternative responses permitted.**

---

## SECTION 4: Intake Enforcement

Staff must confirm:

- [ ] Intake checklist is fully completed
- [ ] Funding pathway is assigned before payment
- [ ] Documentation is signed before access
- [ ] No enrollment occurs without intake approval

**Skipping intake is a policy violation.**

---

## SECTION 5: Payment Handling Rules

**Staff may:**
- Collect payments only after pathway assignment
- Explain payment terms once
- Direct payment questions back to policy

**Staff may not:**
- Adjust payment amounts
- Extend timelines
- Collect partial payments
- Accept manual payment promises

---

## SECTION 6: Escalation Protocol

**Staff escalate only when:**
- Employer sponsorship documentation is pending
- Workforce eligibility requires agency coordination
- Executive approval is required for nonstandard cases

**Escalation does not include payment negotiation.**

---

## SECTION 7: Performance Auditing (Management Responsibility)

Leadership reviews monthly:

- [ ] Enrollment-to-completion ratios
- [ ] Funding pathway distribution
- [ ] Payment compliance
- [ ] Withdrawals related to affordability
- [ ] Script deviation reports

**Patterns trigger retraining or removal from admissions.**

---

## SECTION 8: Termination Thresholds

**Immediate retraining required if staff:**
- Deviates from script twice
- Negotiates payment terms
- Enrolls without completed intake

**Removal from admissions role if:**
- Policy is overridden
- Unauthorized promises are made
- Financial exposure is created

**This protects the institution, not egos.**

---

## Final Statement for Staff

*Read aloud during training:*

> "Access is not the same as flexibility.  
> Structure is how we protect students and the institution.  
> Our job is placement into the right pathway—not persuasion."
