## Pathway Determination

Based on answers, use this decision tree:

```
Unemployed/underemployed OR receives public assistance OR justice-involved OR has disability?
  │
  ├─ YES → "Based on what you've shared, you likely qualify for workforce funding 
  │         that could cover your tuition. Let me explain how that works."
  │         → GO TO: Workforce Funding Script
  │
  ▼ NO
Does employer offer tuition support?
  │
  ├─ YES → "Great news — your employer may be able to sponsor your training.
  │         Let me explain how employer sponsorship works."
  │         → GO TO: Employer Sponsorship Script
  │
  ▼ NO
"You may need to pay tuition directly. We have a few options including 
 pay-over-time financing and a school payment plan. Let me explain."
  → GO TO: Self-Pay Script
```

## Workforce Funding Script

> "Elevate for Humanity is approved for workforce funding through programs like WIOA and the Workforce Ready Grant. Here's how it works:
>
> 1. You'll need to visit your local WorkOne office or contact your case manager
> 2. They'll verify your eligibility and issue a training voucher
> 3. Once we receive the voucher, you can enroll at no cost to you
>
> The funding covers your full tuition. You pay nothing out of pocket.
>
> Would you like me to give you the WorkOne contact information for your area?"

**If student asks "Can I just pay myself?"**
> "You can, but I'd recommend checking your funding eligibility first. Most of our students qualify for workforce funding, and there's no reason to pay if you don't have to. Let's start there."

**If student is impatient about the process:**
> "I understand you want to get started quickly. The funding process usually takes 1-2 weeks. If you'd prefer to pay directly and start sooner, I can explain those options. But the funding is worth exploring first."

---

## Employer Sponsorship Script

> "Employer sponsorship is a great option. Here's how it works:
>
> 1. Your employer signs a sponsorship agreement with us
> 2. We invoice them directly for your tuition
> 3. You pay nothing out of pocket, or they may deduct from your paycheck after you're hired
>
> I'll need to speak with your employer's HR department to set this up. Can you provide their contact information?"

**If student says employer hasn't confirmed:**
> "Before we can proceed with employer sponsorship, we need a signed agreement from your employer. Once you have that confirmation, give us a call and we'll get you enrolled right away."

**Do NOT enroll on verbal employer promises.**

---

## Self-Pay Script

> "For students paying directly, we have three options:
>
> **Option 1: Pay in Full**
> Pay your full tuition today and start immediately.
>
> **Option 2: Pay Over Time with Affirm or Klarna**
> At checkout, you can apply for financing. If approved, you'll pay in monthly installments directly to them. This is subject to their approval.
>
> **Option 3: School Payment Plan**
> If financing isn't available to you, we offer a payment plan with a deposit and monthly autopay. The deposit is 20% of tuition, and you pay the rest over 6 months maximum.
>
> Which option sounds right for you?"

**If student asks for longer than 6 months:**
> "Our payment plans are limited to 6 months. That's our policy and I'm not able to extend it. If that doesn't work for you, I'd recommend exploring the workforce funding options we discussed — most students qualify and pay nothing."

**If student asks for lower down payment:**
> "The minimum down payment is 20% of tuition or $500, whichever is greater. That's a fixed requirement. If that's a barrier right now, let's revisit the workforce funding options."

**If student asks for manual payments instead of autopay:**
> "All payment plans require autopay. We don't accept manual payments. This protects both you and us by ensuring payments are never missed."

**NEVER SAY:**
- "Let me see what I can do"
- "Maybe we can work something out"
- "I'll ask my manager"

## Closing (Every Call/Meeting)

### If student is ready to enroll:
> "Great! Here's what happens next:
> 1. [Funding pathway specific steps]
> 2. You'll complete enrollment paperwork
> 3. We'll confirm your start date
>
> Do you have any questions before we proceed?"

### If student needs to take action first:
> "Here's your next step: [specific action].
> Once that's complete, call us back at [number] and we'll get you enrolled.
> Do you have any questions?"

### If student is not ready:
> "I understand. When you're ready to move forward, give us a call. We're here to help.
> Is there anything else I can answer for you today?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "That's too expensive"
> "I understand cost is a concern. That's why we always check funding eligibility first. Based on what you shared, you may qualify for workforce funding that covers the full tuition. Would you like to explore that?"

### "I need to start right away"
> "Our next cohort starts [DATE]. If you need to start sooner, paying in full or using Affirm/Klarna at checkout are the fastest options. The funding process takes 1-2 weeks but is worth it if you qualify."

### "Can you hold a spot for me?"
> "We don't hold spots without a deposit or funding authorization. Once you have one of those, we can confirm your enrollment."

### "Other schools are cheaper"
> "Our tuition reflects the quality of training and the credentials you'll earn. More importantly, most of our students pay nothing because they qualify for workforce funding. Have you checked your eligibility?"

### "I'll think about it"
> "Of course. When you're ready, call us at [number]. Just know that cohort sizes are limited and fill up quickly."

## Daily Reminders

Before every shift, remember:

1. **Lead with funding.** Most students qualify. Don't skip this.
2. **Follow the script.** Consistency protects everyone.
3. **Document everything.** Notes in the CRM after every interaction.
4. **No verbal promises.** If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist.
5. **Protect the institution.** Saying "no" to the wrong enrollment is the right decision.
