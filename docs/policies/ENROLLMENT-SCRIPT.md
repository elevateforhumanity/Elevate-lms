# Admissions Funding Script
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — REQUIRED READING FOR ALL ADMISSIONS STAFF**

**Version:** 2.0 - FINAL  
**Effective:** January 2025

---

## Purpose

This script removes emotion, negotiation, and confusion from admissions conversations.

**You train to this. You audit to this. No deviation.**

---

## Opening (Set Authority Immediately)

> "Elevate for Humanity is a workforce training institute. Most of our students do not pay tuition on their own. Before enrollment, we place every applicant into one of our three funding pathways."

---

## Step 1: Frame the Process

> "Our first step is eligibility screening. We determine whether your training can be workforce-funded, employer-sponsored, or structured tuition."

> "Funding is decided before enrollment so there are no surprises."

---

## Step 2: Explain the Priority Order

> "Our priority is always workforce funding or employer sponsorship because those options minimize or eliminate student cost."

> "If you qualify for public funding or employer sponsorship, tuition may be fully covered."

---

## Step 3: Introduce Structured Tuition (Without Apology)

> "If you do not qualify for workforce or employer funding, we offer a structured student tuition option."

> "This is not open-ended and it is not negotiated. It is a short bridge designed to help students start training while transitioning to a permanent funding solution."

---

## Step 4: State the Numbers Clearly

> "The structured tuition option requires a $500 initial payment and $200 per month for up to three months."

> "At the end of that period, remaining tuition must be resolved through employer reimbursement, approved external financing, or full payment."

---

## Step 5: Set the Boundary

> "We do not offer long-term internal payment plans, and we do not extend credit."

> "This structure allows us to keep programs accessible while maintaining program quality."

---

## Step 6: Handle the $100/Month Objection (Scripted Response)

> "I understand that $100 per month feels more comfortable. At that level, a student would need a long-term payor. That's why we route those situations to workforce funding, employer sponsorship, or external financing rather than internal plans."

> "Our goal is to help you succeed without putting you into an arrangement that isn't sustainable."

---

## Step 7: Close with Direction

> "The next step is to complete eligibility screening so we can place you into the correct funding pathway."

> "Once funding is confirmed, we finalize enrollment."

---

## Staff Are NOT Allowed to Say

These statements violate policy:

- ❌ "We might be able to work something out"
- ❌ "Let me ask if we can stretch it"
- ❌ "We've made exceptions before"
- ❌ "You can just pay what you can"
- ❌ "Let me see what I can do"
- ❌ "Maybe we can work something out"
- ❌ "I'll ask my manager"

**Any of these statements is a policy violation.**

---

## Internal Enforcement Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a student continues to negotiate after the structure is explained once, staff respond with:

> "These are our funding pathways. If none of these options work right now, we recommend waiting until another funding option becomes available."

**No defensiveness. No guilt. No chasing.**

---

## Handling Continued Pushback

If student persists after the enforcement response:

> "I understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for. Our funding pathways are designed to set students up for success, not financial strain. When your situation changes, we'd be happy to revisit enrollment."

Then end the conversation professionally.

## What You Cannot Do

❌ Negotiate tuition amounts  
❌ Offer discounts  
❌ Extend payment terms beyond 3 months internally  
❌ Accept payments below $200/month internally  
❌ Waive the $500 initial payment  
❌ Accept manual payments (autopay only)  
❌ Promise anything not in this script  
❌ Enroll without funding confirmed or payment agreement signed  

---

## What You Must Do

✅ Lead with eligibility screening  
✅ Follow this script exactly  
✅ Document every interaction in the CRM  
✅ Route to workforce funding first  
✅ Get signed agreements before enrollment  
✅ Say "no" when the answer is no  

---

## Core Principles

**Consistency matters more than generosity.**

**Clarity builds trust faster than flexibility.**

**Boundaries protect access long-term.**

---

## Escalation

If a student requests something outside this script:

1. Deliver the enforcement response (above)
2. If they persist, say: "Let me have our Program Director follow up with you."
3. Document the interaction
4. Do NOT make promises

Program Director will review and respond within 24 hours.

*This script is mandatory. Deviation without written Executive Director approval is a policy violation subject to disciplinary action.*
