# Dual-Track Growth Playbook
## Elevate for Humanity Career and Training Institute

**INTERNAL DOCUMENT — LEADERSHIP EXECUTION GUIDE**

**Version:** 1.0 - FINAL  
**Effective:** January 2025  
**Timeline:** 30–60 Day Operating Push

---

## Purpose

To increase enrollment through workforce referrals and employer sponsorship simultaneously, without diluting focus or loosening financial controls.

---

## LEVER 1: Workforce Referrals

**Timeline:** 30 days  
**Type:** Fastest, most predictable  
**Driver:** Relationship-driven, not marketing-driven

### Week 1–2 Actions

**1. Designate One Workforce Liaison**

One person owns relationships with:
- Workforce boards
- Career navigators
- Case managers

This is not admissions. This is not marketing. One accountable role.

**2. Standardize the Referral Packet (One Page)**

Must include:
- Program name and duration
- Credential earned
- Tuition amount ($5,000)
- WIOA eligibility alignment
- Outcomes (job titles, wage ranges)
- Start dates and capacity

**Anything longer than one page does not get read.**

### Week 2–4 Actions

**3. Target Referral Hubs, Not Agencies**

Build trust with frontline navigators at:
- American Job Center partners
- Local workforce boards
- Vocational Rehabilitation offices
- Re-entry program coordinators

**Your ask is simple:**
> "We can take X students per cohort. We handle intake cleanly. We report outcomes."

**4. Close the Loop Visibly**

Every referral gets:
- Confirmation of enrollment
- Attendance status updates
- Completion notice

**Case managers send students to providers who don't make them chase information.**

### Why This Works

Workforce referrals move when providers feel safe sending people. Safety comes from structure, not charm.

You now have the structure.

## LEVER 2: Employer Sponsorship

**Timeline:** 45–60 days  
**Type:** Higher yield, slightly slower  
**Driver:** Reduces dependency on public funding

### Week 1–3 Actions

**1. Stop Selling "Training." Start Selling Risk Reduction.**

Employers do not care about curriculum. They care about:
- Time-to-productivity
- Turnover reduction
- Predictable onboarding

**Your pitch:**
> "We pre-train. You reimburse after hire. You reduce churn."

**2. Offer One Sponsorship Model Only (At First)**

Do not offer menus.

Use:
- Post-hire reimbursement
- $250–$400/month
- 12–20 months
- Tuition tied to retention

This feels reasonable to employers and manageable for payroll.

### Week 3–6 Actions

**3. Limit Employer Seats Intentionally**

Scarcity builds seriousness.

> "We are opening 10 sponsored seats this quarter."

Unlimited offers get ignored.

**4. Formalize the Employer Agreement**

Simple, clear, no legal gymnastics:
- Hire requirement
- Reimbursement schedule
- Separation clause
- Reporting cadence

**If an employer won't sign something simple, they won't pay reliably.**

### Why This Works

Employer money moves slower—but once it moves, it's sticky. One good employer partner can stabilize multiple cohorts.

## How the Two Levers Reinforce Each Other

| Workforce Agencies | Employers |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Love providers with employer pipelines | Trust providers with public funding credibility |

Running both simultaneously makes you look institutional, not experimental.

---

## What You Do NOT Do While Running Both

- ❌ Do not loosen internal payment terms
- ❌ Do not add new programs
- ❌ Do not change tuition
- ❌ Do not chase every employer

**Focus beats flexibility.**

## Success Metrics (30-Day Check)

| Metric | Target |

| Workforce referrals received | 5+ |
| Employer pitches sent | 5+ |
| Employer conversations started | 2+ |
| Lane 3 enrollment percentage | <40% |

## 60-Day Review Questions

1. Are workforce referrals increasing month-over-month?
2. Is at least one employer agreement signed or in negotiation?
3. Is Lane 3 (internal tuition) staying below 40%?
4. Are case managers responding to outreach?
5. Is the liaison role working or does it need adjustment?

**If any answer is "no" at 60 days, adjust tactics—not strategy.**

*This playbook is reviewed at 30 and 60 days. Adjustments are tactical, not structural.*
