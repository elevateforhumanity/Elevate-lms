## Programs NOT Offered

To avoid confusion, we explicitly do NOT offer:

- ❌ IT/Tech certifications (no current ETPL approval)
- ❌ Medical Assistant (requires clinical partnerships we don't have)
- ❌ Welding (equipment investment not justified)
- ❌ Any program not on Indiana ETPL

**If asked about these, staff response:**
> "That program isn't available at this time. Let me tell you about our CNA and CDL programs, which have strong job placement."

---

## Decision Criteria for Adding Programs

Before ANY new program is considered, it must meet ALL of these:

1. **WIOA/ETPL eligible** — Can workforce funding pay for it?
2. **Employer demand documented** — Do we have 3+ employers ready to hire?
3. **Outcome trackable** — Can we measure job placement within 90 days?
4. **Operationally feasible** — Do we have instructors, space, equipment?
5. **Financially viable** — Will it break even within 2 cohorts?

**If any answer is "no" or "maybe," the program is not added.**

## Enrollment Targets (Q1 2025)

| Program | Monthly Target | Funding Mix |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| CNA | 15-20 students | 70% WIOA, 20% Employer, 10% Self-pay |
| CDL | 8-10 students | 60% WIOA, 30% Employer, 10% Self-pay |
| HVAC | 5-8 students | 50% WIOA, 40% Employer, 10% Self-pay |

**Self-pay should never exceed 15% of any cohort.**

If self-pay exceeds 15%, we are either:
- Not marketing to the right population
- Not connecting students to funding
- Accepting students who shouldn't be enrolled yet

---

## Staff Talking Points

When discussing programs with prospective students:

**Lead with CNA or CDL:**
> "Our most popular programs are CNA and CDL. Both have strong job placement and are usually covered by workforce funding. Which field interests you?"

**If student asks about other programs:**
> "We also offer HVAC training. Let me check if that program has availability and what funding options exist for you."

**If student asks about programs we don't offer:**
> "We don't offer that program currently. Based on your interests, CNA/CDL might be a good fit. Would you like to learn more?"

**Never say:**
- "We're working on adding that"
- "Maybe in the future"
- "Let me see what I can do"

## Review Schedule

Program selection will be reviewed:
- **Quarterly:** Enrollment numbers, completion rates, placement rates
- **Annually:** Full program viability assessment

**Next Review:** April 2025
