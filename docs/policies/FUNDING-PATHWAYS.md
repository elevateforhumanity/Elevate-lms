## How Training Gets Paid For

Elevate for Humanity places students into one of three funding pathways:

1. **Workforce-Funded** — Government and grant programs pay your tuition
2. **Employer-Sponsored** — Your employer pays for your training
3. **Structured Tuition** — You pay through a short-term payment plan

---

## Pathway 1: Workforce-Funded

**Who Pays:** Government workforce agencies, grants, and public programs

**Eligible Programs:**
- WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)
- Workforce Ready Grant (Indiana)
- Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)
- Justice-Involved Reentry Programs (DOC, Community Corrections)
- Veterans Programs

**How It Works:**
1. You apply and are determined eligible by the funding agency
2. The agency issues a voucher or authorization
3. We invoice the agency directly
4. You pay $0 out of pocket

**Your Responsibility:**
- Complete eligibility paperwork
- Attend all required appointments with your case manager
- Maintain satisfactory progress in the program

**Documentation Required:**
- Funding authorization letter or voucher
- Case manager contact information
- Any agency-specific forms

---

## Pathway 2: Employer-Sponsored

**Who Pays:** Your current or future employer

**Options:**
- **Cohort Sponsorship** — Employer pays for a group of employees
- **Per-Seat Payment** — Employer pays tuition for individual employee
- **Post-Hire Reimbursement** — Employer pays after you complete training and are hired

**How It Works:**
1. Employer signs a sponsorship agreement
2. We invoice the employer directly
3. You pay $0 out of pocket (or employer deducts from payroll post-hire)

**Requirements:**
- Signed employer agreement BEFORE enrollment
- Employer must be approved partner
- Payment terms specified in writing

## Pathway 3: Structured Tuition

**Who Pays:** You, through a short-term payment plan

**This is NOT financial aid.** This is a structured tuition payment arrangement.

**Options:**
- **Pay in Full** — Single payment at enrollment
- **Third-Party Financing** — Affirm or Klarna (subject to approval)
- **School Payment Plan** — Deposit + monthly autopay

**School Payment Plan Terms:**
| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Down Payment | Minimum 20% (at least $500) |
| Maximum Term | 6 months |
| Payment Method | Autopay only — no manual payments |
| Missed Payment | Immediate academic pause |
| Credentials | Released only when balance = $0 |

**Example: $5,000 Tuition**
- Deposit: $1,000
- Monthly Payment: $667 × 6 months
- Total: $5,000
