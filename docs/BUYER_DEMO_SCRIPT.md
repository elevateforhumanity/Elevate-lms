**Say:**
> "Everything a participant needs is in one place — no jumping between systems."

## Minute 10-11: Integrations (If Asked)

**Navigate to:** `/license/integrations`

**Say (for Salesforce specifically):**

**Safe language:**

---

## Minute 11-12: Pricing & Next Steps

**Navigate to:** `/license/pricing`

**Say:**
> "For pricing, we have three tiers. Core Platform starts at $4,999 for single-site deployment. School License at $15,000 includes white-label branding and compliance tools. Enterprise at $50,000 adds the employer portal and AI tutor."

**Point out:**
- Monthly option ($499/mo) for flexibility
- What's included vs implementation-dependent

**Say:**
> "Final pricing depends on your scope and implementation needs. The next step would be a scoping call to understand your requirements and put together a proposal."

---

## Closing

**Say:**
> "What questions do you have? And would it be helpful to schedule a follow-up to discuss your specific use case?"

**If they want to proceed:**
> "Great — I'll send over a summary and we can schedule a scoping call to discuss implementation."

**Navigate to:** `/schedule` (show them the scheduling page)

---

## Objection Handling

### "Is Salesforce fully integrated?"

**Say:**
> "Salesforce integration is supported via API and webhooks. The specific implementation depends on your Salesforce configuration — we'd scope that during implementation planning."

### "Can we customize it?"

**Say:**
> "White-label branding is included with School License and above. Additional customization beyond standard configuration is available through implementation support."

### "What about compliance reporting?"

**Say:**
> "The platform includes enrollment reports, completion tracking, attendance records, and data exports. Specific compliance requirements vary by funding source — we'd discuss your needs during scoping."

### "Is there a trial?"

**Say:**
> "We offer live demos like this one, and the demo pages are publicly accessible for you to explore. For a hands-on trial, we'd discuss that as part of the licensing conversation."
