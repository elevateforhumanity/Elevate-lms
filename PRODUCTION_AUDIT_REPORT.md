/admin/data-import - No DB connection  
/admin/course-generator - No DB connection
/admin/autopilots - No DB connection
/admin/compliance-dashboard - No DB connection
/admin/dashboard-enhanced - No DB connection
... (60+ admin pages without DB)
```

---

## SECTION 6: DO NOT SHIP BLOCKERS

### CRITICAL (Must fix before any deployment)

1. ❌ Programs have no CRUD - cannot create/edit programs
2. ❌ Applications have no update/workflow - cannot process applications
3. ❌ No audit logging - cannot prove compliance
4. ❌ 743 pages without database connection
5. ❌ No intakes table - marketing CTAs go nowhere
6. ❌ No cohorts/attendance tracking - cannot run programs

### HIGH (Must fix before production)

1. ⚠️ Partner data isolation not verified
2. ⚠️ Soft delete not implemented
3. ⚠️ Admin actions not logged
4. ⚠️ Document management incomplete

### MEDIUM (Should fix)

1. Profile update missing in admin
2. Certificate generation incomplete
3. Instructor portal limited

---
