## The Opportunity Cost

Every month spent building is a month not serving learners.

- **6 months of development** = 6 months of delayed impact
- **Staff diverted to IT** = Staff not focused on mission
- **Budget on technology** = Budget not on programs

---

## Decision Framework

### Build if:
- You have unique requirements no platform can meet
- You have dedicated IT staff with LMS experience
- Timeline is not a constraint
- Budget exceeds $500,000 for technology alone

### Partner if:
- You need to launch within 30-90 days
- Compliance is a priority
- You want to focus resources on learners, not technology
- You need proven outcomes, not experiments

## Next Steps

If you're evaluating build vs. buy, we recommend a 15-minute scope call to:

1. Understand your specific requirements
