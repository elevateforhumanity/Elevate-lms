- **More Dropdown (12 items):** Platform, Metrics, Licensing, Agencies, Students, Employers, Transparency, AI Tutor, Marketplace, Booking, News, Contact
- **Contextual Access:** Features appear in relevant dashboards/pages
- **Direct URL:** All features accessible via direct URL

**This is intentional and follows UX best practices.**
