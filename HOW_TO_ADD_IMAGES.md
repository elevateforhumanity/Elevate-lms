# How to Add Images - Simple Guide

Your site is ready for images. Follow these steps to add them:

## Step 1: Download Images from Artlist

Open each URL in your browser and download the image:

1. **Supersonic Hero**: https://artlist.io/text-to-image-ai/creations/ae1fd783-34c7-4468-81a3-aba4e1e87813
2. **Instant Cash CTA**: https://artlist.io/text-to-image-ai/creations/a6fb219d-6fb7-401d-9da9-d40a6819f204
3. **Subpages Hero**: https://artlist.io/text-to-image-ai/creations/a34be5f8-316c-47ed-925d-c65e14bcba67
4. **Skilled Trades**: https://artlist.io/text-to-image-ai/creations/5573d3b3-65e3-4dc5-9735-9955ae90e593

## Step 2: Rename Downloaded Images

Rename each downloaded image:

- Image 1 → `hero-banner.jpg`
- Image 2 → `cta-instant-cash.jpg`
- Image 3 → `subpage-hero.jpg`
- Image 4 → `skilled-trades-hero.jpg`

## Step 3: Upload to Correct Folders

Place the renamed images in these folders:

```
public/images/supersonic-fast-cash/
├── hero-banner.jpg          (Image 1)
├── cta-instant-cash.jpg     (Image 2)
└── subpage-hero.jpg         (Image 3)

public/images/career-services/
└── hero-banner.jpg          (Copy of Image 3)

public/images/programs/
└── skilled-trades-hero.jpg  (Image 4)
```

## Step 4: Verify

Visit these pages to see your images:
- https://your-site.com/supersonic-fast-cash (hero + CTA)
- https://your-site.com/supersonic-fast-cash/services (subpage hero)
- https://your-site.com/career-services/interview-prep (career hero)
- https://your-site.com/programs/skilled-trades (trades hero)

## That's It!

Once you upload the 4 images (5 files total, one is duplicated), your site will display them automatically.

## Alternative: Use Different Images

If you can't access Artlist, you can use any images you want:
1. Find similar images from Unsplash, Pexels, or your own photos
2. Resize to approximately 1920x1080px
3. Save with the same filenames above
4. Upload to the same folders

The site will work with any images you provide!
