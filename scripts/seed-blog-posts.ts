    title: "From Unemployed to HVAC Technician: Marcus's Success Story",
    slug: "marcus-hvac-success-story",
    excerpt: "After losing his retail job during the pandemic, Marcus Thompson enrolled in our HVAC program. Within 6 months, he landed a $55,000/year position with full benefits.",
    content: `## The Challenge

Marcus Thompson, 34, had spent 8 years climbing the ladder in retail management. When COVID-19 hit Indianapolis in March 2020, his store closed permanently.

"I applied to over 200 jobs in three months," Marcus recalls. "Retail was dead, and I didn't have skills for anything else."

## Discovering a New Path

Marcus's unemployment counselor at WorkOne Indianapolis suggested WIOA-funded training. That's when he found Elevate for Humanity's HVAC Technician program.

"When I saw the job outlook—95% placement rate, average starting salary of $45,000—I knew I had to try."

## The Training Experience

Marcus enrolled in the 20-week HVAC program covering:
- Heating system installation and repair
- Air conditioning fundamentals
- Refrigeration principles
- EPA 608 certification preparation
- Customer service and job site safety

Through WIOA funding, Marcus paid nothing out of pocket—$0 tuition, $0 for tools, $0 for certification exams.

## The Results

Marcus completed training and passed his EPA 608 certification on the first attempt. Within two weeks, he had three job offers.

He accepted a position with ServiceMaster Climate Control:
- Starting salary: $52,000/year
- Full health, dental, and vision insurance
- Company vehicle and gas card
- 401(k) with 4% match

## One Year Later

Today, Marcus has been promoted to Lead Technician earning $58,000 annually.

"I went from unemployed and hopeless to having a real career with a future. Elevate for Humanity changed my life."
