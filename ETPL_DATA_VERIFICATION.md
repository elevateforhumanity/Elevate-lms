### Program Description (Official)
The Indiana Barbering Apprenticeship Program is a registered, earn-and-learn training program that prepares participants for barber licensure and employment. The program is delivered in two required components: instructional training and on-the-job training (OJT).

**Instructional Training (Milady RISE)**
Participants complete the instructional portion of the program using Milady RISE, an industry-recognized barbering curriculum aligned with Indiana licensing standards. Instruction includes coursework in haircutting, shaving, sanitation and safety, skin and scalp care, customer service, professionalism, and state laws. This portion of the program is delivered through structured online modules and assessments to ensure participants gain the required technical knowledge before entering full-time shop training.

**On-the-Job Training (Licensed Barbershop)**
After completing the instructional training, participants enter a licensed barbershop to complete supervised, paid on-the-job training hours. Apprentices work under the guidance of a licensed barber-mentor and apply classroom instruction in a real-world setting. All training hours are documented and tracked in accordance with Indiana apprenticeship and licensing requirements.

This program is part of a 2,000-hour Registered Apprenticeship and meets Indiana State Board of Barber Examiners, Department of Workforce Development, and U.S. Department of Labor standards. Upon completion, participants are prepared to sit for the state licensure examination and pursue employment as professional barbers.
