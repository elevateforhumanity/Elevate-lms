    question: "How do I get my barber license?",
    answer: "To obtain an Indiana barber license, you must complete the required instructional hours at a licensed barber school, complete the apprenticeship program, and pass the state licensing examination administered by the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (IPLA)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in the Related Instruction?",
    answer: "Related Instruction is provided through the Milady theory curriculum, which covers barbering fundamentals, sanitation, safety, customer service, and state law. This is the classroom/theory component of the apprenticeship."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I earn money during the apprenticeship?",
    answer: "Yes. During the on-the-job training (OJT) portion at a licensed barbershop, you work as a paid apprentice under the supervision of a licensed barber."
  },
