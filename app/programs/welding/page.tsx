      question: "Do I need any experience to start welding training?",
      answer: "No prior experience is required. Our program starts with the fundamentals - safety, equipment operation, and basic techniques. We'll teach you everything from striking your first arc to passing AWS certification tests."
    },
    {
      question: "What welding processes will I learn?",
      answer: "You'll master four primary welding processes: SMAW (Stick), GMAW (MIG), GTAW (TIG), and FCAW (Flux-Core). These cover 95% of welding jobs in manufacturing, construction, and fabrication. You'll also learn oxy-fuel cutting and plasma cutting."
    },
    {
      question: "What certifications will I earn?",
      answer: "You'll earn AWS (American Welding Society) certifications in multiple processes and positions. Specific certs include AWS D1.1 Structural Steel, and you'll be prepared for 3G and 4G plate certifications. These are industry-standard credentials recognized by employers nationwide."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the welding program?",
      answer: "The full program is 12-16 weeks depending on your schedule. We offer day and evening classes. You'll complete approximately 400 hours of hands-on training plus classroom instruction on blueprint reading, welding symbols, and metallurgy."
    },
    {
      question: "Is welding a good career choice?",
      answer: "Absolutely. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects steady demand for welders through 2032. Skilled welders are needed in manufacturing, construction, shipbuilding, aerospace, and energy. Many welders earn $50,000-$80,000+ annually, with underwater and pipeline welders earning over $100,000."
    },
    {
      question: "What safety equipment is provided?",
      answer: "We provide all safety equipment during training including welding helmets with auto-darkening lenses, leather gloves, welding jackets, safety glasses, and respirators. You'll learn proper PPE usage as part of the curriculum."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I specialize in a specific type of welding?",
      answer: "Yes! After mastering fundamentals, many students focus on TIG welding for precision work, pipe welding for higher pay, or structural welding for construction. We help you identify which specialization matches your career goals."
    },
    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after completing the program?",
      answer: "Graduates work as production welders, fabricators, pipe welders, structural welders, welding inspectors, and maintenance welders. Industries include automotive, aerospace, construction, shipbuilding, manufacturing, and energy. Many employers offer apprenticeships that lead to journeyman status."
