    {
      question: "What are the requirements to get a CDL?",
      answer: "You must be at least 18 years old for intrastate (within Indiana) or 21 for interstate driving. You need a valid driver's license, pass a DOT physical exam, have no DUI/DWI convictions in the past 10 years, and pass written knowledge tests and a skills test. We help you through every step."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get my CDL?",
      answer: "Our program is 4-6 weeks for Class A CDL. This includes classroom instruction, behind-the-wheel training, and preparation for your BMV skills test. Some students complete faster depending on prior experience and scheduling."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Class A and Class B CDL?",
      answer: "Class A allows you to drive any combination of vehicles with a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) of 26,001 lbs or more, including tractor-trailers. Class B covers single vehicles over 26,001 lbs like buses and dump trucks. Class A opens more job opportunities and higher pay."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the training paid for through WIOA?",
      answer: "Yes! If you qualify for WIOA funding, your entire CDL training can be covered at no cost to you. This includes tuition, DOT physical, drug screening, permit fees, and even the BMV skills test fee. We help you apply during enrollment."
    },
    {
      question: "What endorsements can I add to my CDL?",
      answer: "We prepare you for Hazmat (H), Tanker (N), Doubles/Triples (T), and Passenger (P) endorsements. Hazmat requires an additional TSA background check. More endorsements mean more job opportunities and higher pay."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to pass a drug test?",
      answer: "Yes, DOT requires pre-employment drug screening and you'll be subject to random testing throughout your career. We include your initial drug screening in the program. The trucking industry has zero tolerance for substance use."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of trucks will I train on?",
      answer: "You'll train on modern automatic and manual transmission trucks. We use day cabs and sleeper cabs so you're prepared for any equipment. Our fleet includes Freightliner, Peterbilt, and Kenworth trucks commonly used by employers."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I earn as a CDL driver?",
      answer: "Entry-level CDL-A drivers in Indiana typically start at $45,000-$55,000 annually. With 1-2 years experience, earnings increase to $60,000-$75,000. Owner-operators and specialized haulers can earn $100,000+. Many companies offer sign-on bonuses of $5,000-$15,000."
