    {
      question: "Do I need experience to start plumbing training?",
      answer: "No prior experience required. We teach everything from basic pipe fitting to complex system installation. You'll learn proper techniques from day one with hands-on practice in our training facility."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to become a licensed plumber?",
      answer: "Our training program is 12-16 weeks. After that, Indiana requires 8,000 hours (about 4 years) of apprenticeship under a licensed plumber before you can take the journeyman exam. Our program prepares you to start that apprenticeship."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between residential and commercial plumbing?",
      answer: "Residential plumbing focuses on homes - water heaters, fixtures, drain lines, and small pipe sizes. Commercial plumbing involves larger buildings with complex systems, bigger pipes, and specialized equipment like grease traps and backflow preventers."
    },
    {
      question: "Is plumbing physically demanding?",
      answer: "Yes, plumbing requires physical fitness. You'll lift heavy materials, work in tight spaces, and spend time on your feet. However, proper techniques and tools minimize strain. Many plumbers work well into their 60s."
    },
    {
      question: "What certifications will I earn?",
      answer: "You'll earn OSHA 10 Safety Certification and our program completion certificate. You'll also learn about backflow prevention certification and medical gas certification, which are valuable add-ons for your career."
    },
    {
      question: "How much do plumbers earn?",
      answer: "Apprentice plumbers in Indiana start at $35-45K. Licensed journeymen earn $55-75K. Master plumbers and business owners can earn $80-120K+. Service plumbers often earn extra through overtime and on-call work."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start my own plumbing business?",
      answer: "Yes! After becoming a licensed master plumber (typically 2+ years after journeyman), you can start your own contracting business. Plumbing businesses have low startup costs compared to other trades and steady demand."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools will I need?",
      answer: "Basic hand tools are provided during training. As an apprentice, you'll build your collection over time. Essential tools include pipe wrenches, tubing cutters, PEX crimpers, and a good set of hand tools. Expect to invest $500-1,500 in quality tools."
