# Performance Audit Report - January 10, 2026

## Current Lighthouse Scores

### Homepage (/)
- **Performance: 46/100** ❌ CRITICAL
- **Accessibility: 96/100** ✅
- **Best Practices: 96/100** ✅
- **SEO: 61/100** ⚠️

### About Page (/about)
- **Performance: 59/100** ❌

### Founder Page (/founder)
- **Performance: 49/100** ❌

### Contact Page (/contact)
- **Performance: 66/100** ⚠️

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint: 5.4s (Target: <2.5s)
**Impact:** Users see blank screen for 5.4 seconds
**Causes:**
- Large JavaScript bundles blocking render
- Images loading synchronously
- No critical CSS inlining
- Render-blocking resources (597ms)

**Required Fixes:**
- [ ] Implement code splitting on all routes
- [ ] Lazy load below-fold images
- [ ] Inline critical CSS
- [ ] Defer non-critical JavaScript
- [ ] Add resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- [ ] Optimize font loading (font-display: swap)

### 2. Total Blocking Time: 3,900ms (Target: <300ms)
**Impact:** Page is unresponsive for 3.9 seconds
**Causes:**
- 62.1KB unused Google Analytics code
- 49.1KB unused JavaScript in main bundle
- 22KB unused JavaScript in vendor bundle
- Heavy React hydration

**Required Fixes:**
- [ ] Remove or defer Google Analytics
- [ ] Tree-shake unused code
- [ ] Split vendor bundles
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports
- [ ] Use React.lazy() for heavy components
- [ ] Move computations to web workers

### 3. Network Payload Issues
**Current:** 30.4KB CSS + large JS bundles
**Causes:**
- Unused CSS (150ms savings available)
- Unused JavaScript (300ms savings available)
- No compression on some assets

**Required Fixes:**
- [ ] Purge unused CSS
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Enable Brotli compression
- [ ] Implement aggressive code splitting

## SEO Issues (Score: 61/100)

### Links Without Descriptive Text
- "Learn more" link to /cookies
- **Fix:** Change to "Learn more about our cookie policy"

### Missing Optimizations
- [ ] Add structured data (JSON-LD)
- [ ] Optimize meta descriptions
- [ ] Add canonical URLs
- [ ] Improve internal linking

## Accessibility Issues (Score: 96/100)

### Minor Issues
- Some focus indicators may need improvement
- Color contrast ratios not verified

## Optimizations Implemented

### Completed
- ✅ Font preloading enabled
- ✅ CSS optimization enabled
- ✅ Package import optimization (lucide-react, radix-ui, recharts, react-hot-toast, date-fns)
- ✅ AVIF format prioritized over WebP
- ✅ Image optimization enabled
- ✅ Console.log statements removed
- ✅ All images have alt text
- ✅ No gradient overlays blocking images
- ✅ All missing images fixed

### Not Completed (Requires Major Refactoring)
- ❌ Code splitting per route
- ❌ Lazy loading components
- ❌ Critical CSS inlining
- ❌ JavaScript bundle optimization
- ❌ Third-party script optimization
- ❌ Service worker implementation
- ❌ Resource hints implementation

## Estimated Impact of Completed Optimizations

Based on changes made:
- Font preloading: +2-5 points
- CSS optimization: +2-3 points
- Package optimization: +1-2 points
- AVIF format: +1-2 points

**Expected new score: 52-58/100** (still failing)

## What's Needed for 90+ Performance Score

1. **Code Splitting** (20-30 point improvement)
   - Split every route into separate bundles
   - Lazy load all non-critical components
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

2. **JavaScript Optimization** (15-20 point improvement)
   - Remove unused code
   - Defer third-party scripts
   - Optimize React rendering
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

3. **Critical CSS** (5-10 point improvement)
   - Inline above-fold CSS
   - Defer below-fold CSS
   - Estimated effort: 1 day

4. **Image Optimization** (5-10 point improvement)
   - Lazy load below-fold images
   - Use blur placeholders
   - Optimize image sizes
   - Estimated effort: 1 day

**Total estimated effort: 5-8 days of full-time work**

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Can do now)
1. Fix "Learn more" link text
2. Add structured data
3. Verify rebuild completes successfully

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement code splitting
2. Lazy load components
3. Optimize JavaScript bundles
4. Add critical CSS

### Long-term (1-2 months)
1. Implement service worker
2. Add resource hints
3. Optimize third-party scripts
4. Continuous performance monitoring

## Testing Environment Limitations

- Build times: 3-4 minutes (times out in CI)
- No browser dev tools available
- No mobile device testing
- No accessibility testing tools
- Cannot verify optimizations without completed rebuild

## Conclusion

Current performance is **FAILING** (46/100). Optimizations implemented may improve score to 52-58/100, but achieving 90+ requires major refactoring estimated at 5-8 days of work.

**Priority:** Fix LCP and TBT through code splitting and JavaScript optimization.
